<h2>I. The Book of Beasts</h2>


<p>He happened to be building a Palace when the news
came, and he left all the bricks kicking about the floor
for Nurse to clear up&mdash;but then the news was rather
remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front
door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it
was the man come to see about the gas, which had not
been allowed to be lighted since the day when Lionel
made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the gas
bracket.</p>

<p>And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in and said,
"Master Lionel, dear, they've come to fetch you to go and
be King."</p>

<p>Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash
his face and hands and brush his hair, and all the time she
was doing it Lionel kept wriggling and fidgeting and saying,
"Oh, don't, Nurse," and, "I'm sure my ears are quite
clean," or, "Never mind my hair, it's all right," and, "That'll
do."</p>

<p>"You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead
of a King," said Nurse.</p>

<p>The minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off
without waiting for his clean handkerchief, and in the
drawing room there were two very grave-looking gentlemen
in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with velvet
sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very
expensive jam tarts.</p>

<p>They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said:
"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
King of this country, is dead, and now you have got to
come and be King."</p>

<p>"Yes, please, sir," said Lionel, "when does it begin?"</p>

<p>"You will be crowned this afternoon," said the grave
gentleman who was not quite so grave-looking as the
other.</p>

<p>"Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would
you like me to be fetched, and hadn't I better put on my
velvet suit with the lace collar?" said Lionel, who had
often been out to tea.</p>

<p>"Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later. No,
never mind about changing your suit; the Royal robes will
cover all that up."</p>

<p>The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight
white horses, which was drawn up in front of the house
where Lionel lived. It was No. 7, on the left-hand side of
the street as you go up.</p>

<p>Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed
Nurse and said: "Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let
you do the other ear. No&mdash;there's no time now. Give me
the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, ducky," said Nurse. "Be a good little King
now, and say 'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to
pass the cake to the little girls, and don't have more than
two helps of anything."</p>

<p>So off went Lionel to be made a King. He had never
expected to be a King any more than you have, so it was
all quite new to him&mdash;so new that he had never even
thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he
had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because
if his tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half
an hour before he had been building with bricks in the
nursery; and now&mdash;the streets were all fluttering with
flags; every window was crowded with people waving
handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet
soldiers everywhere along the pavements, and all the
bells of all the churches were ringing like mad, and like a
great song to the music of their ringing he heard thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>sands
of people shouting, "Long live Lionel! Long live our
little King!"</p>

<p>He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his
best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about that. If he
had been a girl he would very likely have bothered about
it the whole time.</p>

<p>As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the
Chancellor and the Prime Minister, explained the things
which Lionel did not understand.</p>

<p>"I thought we were a Republic," said Lionel. "I'm sure
there hasn't been a King for some time."</p>

<p>"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's
death happened when my grandfather was a little boy,"
said the Prime Minister, "and since then your loyal people
have been saving up to buy you a crown&mdash;so much a
week, you know, according to people's means&mdash;sixpence
a week from those who have first-rate pocket money,
down to a halfpenny a week from those who haven't so
much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be paid
for by the people."</p>

<p>"But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather
a crown?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity,
and he had had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to
buy books. He was a strange man; a very good King he
was, but he had his faults&mdash;he was fond of books. Almost
with his last breath he sent the crown to be tinned&mdash;and
he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill."</p>

<p>Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just
then the carriage stopped and Lionel was taken out of the
carriage to be crowned. Being crowned is much more tiring
work than you would suppose, and by the time it was
over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or
two and had had his hand kissed by everybody whose
business it was to do it, he was quite worn out, and was
very glad to get into the Palace nursery.</p>

<p>Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and
plummy cake, and jam and hot buttered toast, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
prettiest china with red and gold and blue flowers on it,
and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked.</p>

<p>After tea Lionel said: "I think I should like a book. Will
you get me one, Nurse?"</p>

<p>"Bless the child," said Nurse. "You don't suppose
you've lost the use of your legs with just being a King?
Run along, do, and get your books yourself."</p>

<p>So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime
Minister and the Chancellor were there, and when Lionel
came in they bowed very low, and were beginning to ask
Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming bothering
for now&mdash;when Lionel cried out: "Oh, what a worldful
of books! Are they yours?"</p>

<p>"They are yours, Your Majesty," answered the
Chancellor. "They were the property of the late King, your
great-great&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," Lionel interrupted. "Well, I shall read
them all. I love to read. I am so glad I learned to read."</p>

<p>"If I might venture to advise Your Majesty," said the
Prime Minister, "I should not read these books. Your
great&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Lionel, quickly.</p>

<p>"He was a very good King&mdash;oh, yes, really a very superior
King in his way, but he was a little&mdash;well, strange."</p>

<p>"Mad?" asked Lionel, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"No, no"&mdash;both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked.
"Not mad; but if I may express it so, he was&mdash;er&mdash;too
clever by half. And I should not like a little King of mine to
have anything to do with his books."</p>

<p>Lionel looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"The fact is," the Chancellor went on, twisting his red
beard in an agitated way, "your great&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," said Lionel.</p>

<p>"&mdash;was called a wizard."</p>

<p>"But he wasn't?"</p>

<p>"Of course not&mdash;a most worthy King was your great&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"But I wouldn't touch his books."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just this one," cried Lionel, laying his hands on the
cover of a great brown book that lay on the study table. It
had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps
with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold
corners, so that the leather should not wear out too
quickly.</p>

<p>"I must look at this one," Lionel said, for on the back in
big letters he read: <i>The Book of Beasts</i>.</p>

<p>The Chancellor said, "Don't be a silly little King."</p>

<p>But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he
opened the first page, and there was a beautiful Butterfly
all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully
painted that it looked as if it were alive.</p>

<p>"There," said Lionel, "Isn't that lovely? Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its
many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book,
and flew up and out of the window.</p>

<p>"Well!" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could
speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat
and tried to choke him, "that's magic, that is."</p>

<p>But before he had spoken, the King had turned the next
page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful
in every blue feather of him. Under him was written, "Blue
Bird of Paradise," and while the King gazed enchanted at
the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on
the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book.</p>

<p>Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from
the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird
had been, and put it on a very high shelf. And the
Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said:
"You're a naughty, disobedient little King!" and was very
angry indeed.</p>

<p>"I don't see that I've done any harm," said Lionel. He
hated being shaken, as all boys do; he would much rather
have been slapped.</p>

<p>"No harm?" said the Chancellor. "Ah&mdash;but what do you
know about it? That's the question. How do you know
what might have been on the next page&mdash;a snake or a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like
that."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you," said Lionel. "Come,
let's kiss and be friends." So he kissed the Prime Minister,
and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts
and crosses while the Chancellor went to add up his
accounts.</p>

<p>But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking
of the book, and when the full moon was shining with
all her might and light he got up and crept down to the
library and climbed up and got <i>The Book of Beasts</i>.</p>

<p>He took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight
was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw
the empty pages with "Butterfly" and "Blue Bird of
Paradise" underneath, and then he turned the next page.
There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm
tree, and under it was written "Dragon." The Dragon did
not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly
and went back to bed.</p>

<p>But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the
book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps
with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by
itself at the picture with "Dragon" underneath, and the
sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a
great Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast
scarlet wings and flew away across the garden to the far
hills, and Lionel was left with the empty page before him,
for the page was quite empty except for the green palm
tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red
where the paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline
of the Red Dragon.</p>

<p>And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had
not been King twenty-four hours, and already he had let
loose a Red Dragon to worry his faithful subjects' lives
out. And they had been saving up so long to buy him a
crown, and everything!</p>

<p>Lionel began to cry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;The dragon flew away across the garden.&quot; <br /><a href="#Page_8"><i>See page 8.</i></a></span>
</div>

<p>The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
all came running to see what was the matter. And when
they saw the book they understood, and the Chancellor
said: "You naughty little King! Put him to bed, Nurse, and
let him think over what he's done."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, my Lord," said the Prime Minister, "we'd better
first find out just exactly what he has done."</p>

<p>Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said: "It's a Red Dragon,
and it's gone flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry,
and, oh, do forgive me!"</p>

<p>But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other
things to think of than forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to
consult the police and see what could be done. Everyone
did what they could. They sat on committees and stood
on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up
in the hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The
faithful Nurse, meanwhile, did not neglect her duty.
Perhaps she did more than anyone else, for she slapped
the King and put him to bed without his tea, and when it
got dark she would not give him a candle to read by.</p>

<p>"You are a naughty little King," she said, "and nobody
will love you."</p>

<p>Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more
poetic of Lionel's subjects could see the redness of the
Dragon shining through the green trees quite plainly. So
Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he
wanted to make some laws.</p>

<p>And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister
and the Chancellor and the Nurse might have the very
poorest opinion of Lionel's private judgement, and might
even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he got on
his throne and set his crown on his head, he became infallible&mdash;which
means that everything he said was right, and
that he couldn't possibly make a mistake. So when he
said: "There is to be a law forbidding people to open
books in schools or elsewhere"&mdash;he had the support of at
least half of his subjects, and the other half&mdash;the grown-up
half&mdash;pretended to think he was quite right.</p>

<p>Then he made a law that everyone should always have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
enough to eat. And this pleased everyone except the ones
who had always had too much.</p>

<p>And when several other nice new laws were made and
written down he went home and made mud-houses and
was very happy. And he said to his Nurse: "People will
love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for
them."</p>

<p>But Nurse said: "Don't count your chickens, my dear.
You haven't seen the last of that Dragon yet."</p>

<p>Now, the next day was Saturday. And in the afternoon
the Dragon suddenly swooped down upon the common in
all his hideous redness, and carried off the Soccer
Players, umpires, goal-posts, ball, and all.</p>

<p>Then the people were very angry indeed, and they said:
"We might as well be a Republic. After saving up all these
years to get his crown, and everything!"</p>

<p>And wise people shook their heads and foretold a
decline in the National Love of Sport. And, indeed, soccer
was not at all popular for some time afterward.</p>

<p>Lionel did his best to be a good King during the week,
and the people were beginning to forgive him for letting
the Dragon out of the book. "After all," they said, "soccer
is a dangerous game, and perhaps it is wise to discourage
it."</p>

<p>Popular opinion held that the Soccer Players, being
tough and hard, had disagreed with the Dragon so much
that he had gone away to some place where they only
play cats' cradle and games that do not make you hard
and tough.</p>

<p>All the same, Parliament met on the Saturday afternoon,
a convenient time, for most of the Members would
be free to attend, to consider the Dragon. But unfortunately
the Dragon, who had only been asleep, woke up
because it was Saturday, and he considered the
Parliament, and afterwards there were not any Members
left, so they tried to make a new Parliament, but being a
member of Parliament had somehow grown as unpopular
as soccer playing, and no one would consent to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
elected, so they had to do without a Parliament. When the
next Saturday came around everyone was a little nervous,
but the Red Dragon was pretty quiet that day and only ate
an Orphanage.</p>

<p>Lionel was very, very unhappy. He felt that it was his
disobedience that had brought this trouble on the
Parliament and the Orphanage and the Soccer Players,
and he felt that it was his duty to try and do something.
The question was, what?</p>

<p>The Blue Bird that had come out of the book used to
sing very nicely in the Palace rose garden, and the
Butterfly was very tame, and would perch on his shoulder
when he walked among the tall lilies: so Lionel saw that all
the creatures in <i>The Book of Beasts</i> could not be wicked,
like the Dragon, and he thought: "Suppose I could get
another beast out who would fight the Dragon?"</p>

<p>So he took <i>The Book of Beasts</i> out into the rose garden
and opened the page next to the one where the Dragon
had been just a tiny bit to see what the name was. He
could only see "cora," but he felt the middle of the page
swelling up thick with the creature that was trying to
come out, and it was only by putting the book down and
sitting on it suddenly, very hard, that he managed to get it
shut. Then he fastened the clasps with the rubies and
turquoises in them and sent for the Chancellor, who had
been ill since Saturday, and so had not been eaten with
the rest of the Parliament, and he said: "What animal ends
in 'cora'?"</p>

<p>The Chancellor answered: "The Manticora, of course."</p>

<p>"What is he like?" asked the King.</p>

<p>"He is the sworn foe of Dragons," said the Chancellor.
"He drinks their blood. He is yellow, with the body of a
lion and the face of a man. I wish we had a few Manticoras
here now. But the last died hundreds of years ago&mdash;worse
luck!"</p>

<p>Then the King ran and opened the book at the page that
had "cora" on it, and there was the picture&mdash;Manticora,
all yellow, with a lion's body and a man's face, just as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Chancellor had said. And under the picture was written,
"Manticora."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the
book, rubbing its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously.
It seemed very stupid, and when Lionel gave it a
push and said, "Go along and fight the Dragon, do," it put
its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and hid
behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were
asleep it went around and ate all the pussy-cats in the
town. And then it mewed more than ever. And on the
Saturday morning, when people were a little timid about
going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for
calling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and
drank all the milk that was left in the cans at the doors for
people's teas, and it ate the cans as well.</p>

<p>And just when it had finished the very last little halfpenny
worth, which was short measure, because the milkman's
nerves were quite upset, the Red Dragon came
down the street looking for the Manticora. It edged off
when it saw him coming, for it was not at all the Dragon-fighting
kind; and, seeing no other door open, the poor,
hunted creature took refuge in the General Post Office,
and there the Dragon found it, trying to conceal itself
among the ten o'clock mail. The Dragon fell on the
Manticora at once, and the mail was no defense. The mewings
were heard all over the town. All the kitties and the
milk the Manticora had had seemed to have strengthened
its mew wonderfully. Then there was a sad silence, and
presently the people whose windows looked that way saw
the Dragon come walking down the steps of the General
Post Office spitting fire and smoke, together with tufts of
Manticora fur, and the fragments of the registered letters.
Things were growing very serious. However popular
the King might become during the week, the Dragon was
sure to do something on Saturday to upset the people's
loyalty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;The Manticora took refuge in the General Post Office.&quot;<br /><a href="#Page_13"><i>See page 13.</i></a></span>
</div>

<p>The Dragon was a perfect nuisance for the whole of
Saturday, except during the hour of noon, and then he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to rest under a tree or he would have caught fire from the
heat of the sun. You see, he was very hot to begin with.</p>

<p>At last came a Saturday when the Dragon actually
walked into the Royal nursery and carried off the King's
own pet Rocking Horse. Then the King cried for six days,
and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to stop. He
heard the Blue Bird singing among the roses and saw the
Butterfly fluttering among the lilies, and he said: "Nurse,
wipe my face, please. I am not going to cry any more."</p>

<p>Nurse washed his face, and told him not to be a silly little
King. "Crying," said she, "never did anyone any good
yet."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the little King, "I seem to see better,
and to hear better now that I've cried for a week. Now,
Nurse, dear, I know I'm right, so kiss me in case I never
come back. I <i>must</i> try to see if I can't save the people."</p>

<p>"Well, if you must, you must," said Nurse, "but don't
tear your clothes or get your feet wet."</p>

<p>So off he went.</p>

<p>The Blue Bird sang more sweetly than ever, and the
Butterfly shone more brightly, as Lionel once more carried
<i>The Book of Beasts</i> out into the rose garden, and
opened it&mdash;very quickly, so that he might not be afraid
and change his mind. The book fell open wide, almost in
the middle, and there was written at the bottom of the
page, "Hippogriff," and before Lionel had time to see what
the picture was, there was a fluttering of great wings and
a stamping of hoofs, and a sweet, soft, friendly neighing;
and there came out of the book a beautiful white horse
with a long, long, white mane and a long, long, white tail,
and he had great wings like swan's wings, and the softest,
kindest eyes in the world, and he stood there among the
roses.</p>

<p>The Hippogriff rubbed its silky-soft, milky white nose
against the little King's shoulder, and the little King
thought: "But for the wings you are very like my poor,
dear lost Rocking Horse." And the Blue Bird's song was
very loud and sweet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Then suddenly the King saw coming through the sky
the great straggling, sprawling, wicked shape of the Red
Dragon. And he knew at once what he must do. He caught
up <i>The Book of Beasts</i> and jumped on the back of the
gentle, beautiful Hippogriff, and leaning down he whispered
in the sharp, white ear: "Fly, dear Hippogriff, fly
your very fastest to the Pebbly Waste."</p>

<p>And when the Dragon saw them start, he turned and
flew after them, with his great wings flapping like clouds
at sunset, and the Hippogriff's wide wings were snowy as
clouds at moonrise.</p>

<p>When the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off
after the Hippogriff and the King they all came out of their
houses to look, and when they saw the two disappear
they made up their minds to the worst, and began to think
what they would wear for Court mourning.</p>

<p>But the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff. The red
wings were bigger than the white ones, but they were not
so strong, and so the white-winged horse flew away and
away and away, with the Dragon pursuing, till he reached
the very middle of the Pebbly Waste.</p>

<p>Now, the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside
where there is no sand&mdash;all round, loose, shifting
stones, and there is no grass there and no tree within a
hundred miles of it.</p>

<p>Lionel jumped off the white horse's back in the very
middle of the Pebbly Waste, and he hurriedly unclasped
<i>The Book of Beasts</i> and laid it open on the pebbles. Then
he clattered among the pebbles in his haste to get back on
to his white horse, and had just jumped on when up came
the Dragon. He was flying very feebly, and looking around
everywhere for a tree, for it was just on the stroke of
twelve, the sun was shining like a gold guinea in the blue
sky, and there was not a tree for a hundred miles.</p>

<p>The white-winged horse flew around and around the
Dragon as he writhed on the dry pebbles. He was getting
very hot: indeed, parts of him even had begun to smoke.
He knew that he must certainly catch fire in another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
minute unless he could get under a tree. He made a snatch
with his red claws at the King and Hippogriff, but he was
too feeble to reach them, and besides, he did not dare to
overexert himself for fear he should get any hotter.</p>

<p>It was then that he saw <i>The Book of Beasts</i> lying on the
pebbles, open at the page with "Dragon" written at the
bottom. He looked and he hesitated, and he looked again,
and then, with one last squirm of rage, the Dragon wriggled
himself back into the picture and sat down under the
palm tree, and the page was a little singed as he went in.</p>

<p>As soon as Lionel saw that the Dragon had really been
obliged to go and sit under his own palm tree because it
was the only tree there, he jumped off his horse and shut
the book with a bang.</p>

<p>"Oh, hurrah!" he cried. "Now we really have done it."</p>

<p>And he clasped the book very tightly with the turquoise
and ruby clasps.</p>

<p>"Oh, my precious Hippogriff," he cried. "You are the
bravest, dearest, most beautiful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush," whispered the Hippogriff modestly. "Don't you
see that we are not alone?"</p>

<p>And indeed there was quite a crowd round them on the
Pebbly Waste: the Prime Minister and the Parliament and
the Soccer Players and the Orphanage and the Manticora
and the Rocking Horse, and indeed everyone who had
been eaten by the Dragon. You see, it was impossible for
the Dragon to take them into the book with him&mdash;it was a
tight fit even for one Dragon&mdash;so, of course, he had to
leave them outside.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They all got home somehow, and all lived happy ever
after.</p>

<p>When the King asked the Manticora where he would
like to live he begged to be allowed to go back into the
book. "I do not care for public life," he said.</p>

<p>Of course he knew his way onto his own page, so there
was no danger of his opening the book at the wrong page
and letting out a Dragon or anything. So he got back into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his picture and has never come out since: That is why you
will never see a Manticora as long as you live, except in a
picture-book. And of course he left the kitties outside,
because there was no room for them in the book&mdash;and the
milk cans too.</p>

<p>Then the Rocking Horse begged to be allowed to go and
live on the Hippogriff's page of the book. "I should like,"
he said, "to live somewhere where Dragons can't get at
me."</p>

<p>So the beautiful, white-winged Hippogriff showed him
the way in, and there he stayed till the King had him taken
out for his great-great-great-great-grandchildren to play
with.</p>

<p>As for the Hippogriff, he accepted the position of the
King's Own Rocking Horse&mdash;a situation left vacant by
the retirement of the wooden one. And the Blue Bird and
the Butterfly sing and flutter among the lilies and roses
of the Palace garden to this very day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h2>II. Uncle James, or The Purple Stranger</h2>


<p>The Princess and the gardener's boy were playing in
the backyard.</p>

<p>"What will you do when you grow up, Princess?" asked
the gardener's boy.</p>

<p>"I should like to marry you, Tom," said the Princess.
"Would you mind?"</p>

<p>"No," said the gardener's boy. "I shouldn't mind much.
I'll marry you if you like&mdash;if I have time."</p>

<p>For the gardener's boy meant, as soon as he was grown
up, to be a general and a poet and a Prime Minister and
an admiral and a civil engineer. Meanwhile, he was top of
all his classes at school, and tip-top of the geography
class.</p>

<p>As for the Princess Mary Ann, she was a very good little
girl, and everyone loved her. She was always kind and
polite, even to her Uncle James and to other people whom
she did not like very much; and though she was not very
clever, for a Princess, she always tried to do her lessons.
Even if you know perfectly well that you can't do your
lessons, you may as well try, and sometimes you find that
by some fortunate accident they really <i>are</i> done. Then the
Princess had a truly good heart: She was always kind to
her pets. She never slapped her hippopotamus when it
broke her dolls in its playful gambols, and she never forgot
to feed her rhinoceroses in their little hutch in the
backyard. Her elephant was devoted to her, and sometimes
Mary Ann made her nurse quite cross by smuggling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the dear little thing up to bed with her and letting it go to
sleep with its long trunk laid lovingly across her throat,
and its pretty head cuddled under the Royal right ear.</p>

<p>When the Princess had been good all through the
week&mdash;for, like all real, live, nice children, she was sometimes
naughty, but never bad&mdash;Nurse would allow her to
ask her little friends to come on Wednesday morning early
and spend the day, because Wednesday is the end of the
week in that country. Then, in the afternoon, when all the
little dukes and duchesses and marquises and countesses
had finished their rice pudding and had had their hands
and faces washed after it, Nurse would say: "Now, my
dears, what would you like to do this afternoon?" just as
if she didn't know. And the answer would be always the
same:</p>

<p>"Oh, do let's go to the Zoological Gardens and ride on
the big guinea pig and feed the rabbits and hear the dormouse
asleep."</p>

<p>So their pinafores were taken off and they all went to
the Zoological Gardens, where twenty of them could ride
at a time on the guinea pig, and where even the little ones
could feed the great rabbits if some grown-up person
were kind enough to lift them up for the purpose.</p>

<p>There always was some such person, because in
Rotundia everybody was kind&mdash;except one.</p>

<p>Now that you have read as far as this you know, of
course, that the Kingdom of Rotundia was a very remarkable
place; and if you are a thoughtful child&mdash;as of course
you are&mdash;you will not need me to tell you what was the
most remarkable thing about it. But in case you are not a
thoughtful child&mdash;and it is just possible of course that you
are not&mdash;I will tell you at once what that most remarkable
thing was. <i>All the animals were the wrong sizes!</i> And this
was how it happened.</p>

<p>In old, old, olden times, when all our world was just
loose earth and air and fire and water mixed up anyhow
like a pudding, and spinning around like mad trying to get
the different things to settle into their proper places, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'around'">round</ins> piece of earth got loose and went spinning away by
itself across the water, which was just beginning to try to
get spread out smooth into a real sea. And as the great
round piece of earth flew away, going around and around
as hard as it could, it met a long piece of hard rock that
had got loose from another part of the puddingy mixture,
and the rock was so hard, and was going so fast, that it ran
its point through the round piece of earth and stuck out
on the other side of it, so that the two together were like
a very-very-much-too-big spinning top.</p>

<p>I am afraid all this is very dull, but you know geography
is never quite lively, and after all, I must give you a little
information even in a fairy tale&mdash;like the powder in jam.</p>

<p>Well, when the pointed rock smashed into the round bit
of earth the shock was so great that it set them spinning
together through the air&mdash;which was just getting into its
proper place, like all the rest of the things&mdash;only, as luck
would have it, they forgot which way around they had
been going, and began to spin around the wrong way.
Presently Center of Gravity&mdash;a great giant who was managing
the whole business&mdash;woke up in the middle of the
earth and began to grumble.</p>

<p>"Hurry up," he said. "Come down and lie still, can't you?"</p>

<p>So the rock with the round piece of earth fell into the
sea, and the point of the rock went into a hole that just fitted
it in the stony sea bottom, and there it spun around
the wrong way seven times and then lay still. And that
round piece of land became, after millions of years, the
Kingdom of Rotundia.</p>

<p>This is the end of the geography lesson. And now for
just a little natural history, so that we may not feel that we
are quite wasting our time. Of course, the consequence of
the island having spun around the wrong way was that
when the animals began to grow on the island they all
grew the wrong sizes. The guinea pig, as you know, was as
big as our elephants, and the elephant&mdash;dear little pet&mdash;was
the size of the silly, tiny, black-and-tan dogs that
ladies carry sometimes in their muffs. The rabbits were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
about the size of our rhinoceroses, and all about the wild
parts of the island they had made their burrows as big as
railway tunnels. The dormouse, of course, was the biggest
of all the creatures. I can't tell you how big he was. Even
if you think of elephants it will not help you at all. Luckily
there was only one of him, and he was always asleep.
Otherwise I don't think the Rotundians could have borne
with him. As it was, they made him a house, and it saved
the expense of a brass band, because no band could possibly
have been heard when the dormouse was talking in
his sleep.</p>

<p>The men and women and children in this wonderful
island were quite the right size, because their ancestors
had come over with the Conqueror long after the island
had settled down and the animals grown on it.</p>

<p>Now the natural history lesson is over, and if you have
been attending, you know more about Rotundia than anyone
there did, except three people: the Lord Chief
Schoolmaster, the Princess's uncle&mdash;who was a magician,
and knew everything without learning it&mdash;and Tom, the
gardener's son.</p>

<p>Tom had learned more at school than anyone else,
because he wished to take a prize. The prize offered by
the Lord Chief Schoolmaster was a <i>History of Rotundia</i>,
beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the back. But
after that day when the Princess said she meant to marry
Tom, the gardener's boy thought it over, and he decided
that the best prize in the world would be the Princess,
and this was the prize Tom meant to take; and when you
are a gardener's son and have decided to marry a
Princess, you will find that the more you learn at school
the better.</p>

<p>The Princess always played with Tom on the days when
the little dukes and marquises did not come to tea&mdash;and
when he told her he was almost sure of the first prize, she
clapped her hands and said: "Dear Tom, dear good, clever
Tom, you deserve all the prizes. And I will give you my pet
elephant&mdash;and you can keep him till we're married."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The pet elephant was called Fido, and the gardener's
son took him away in his coat pocket. He was the dearest
little elephant you ever saw&mdash;about six inches long. But
he was very, very wise&mdash;he could not have been wiser if
he had been a mile high. He lay down comfortably in
Tom's pocket, and when Tom put in his hand, Fido curled
his little trunk around Tom's fingers with an affectionate
confidence that made the boy's heart warm to his new little
pet. What with the elephant, and the Princess's affection,
and the knowledge that the very next day he would
receive the <i>History of Rotundia</i>, beautifully bound, with
the Royal arms on the cover, Tom could hardly sleep a
wink. And, besides, the dog did bark so terribly. There
was only one dog in Rotundia&mdash;the kingdom could not
afford to keep more than one: He was a Mexican lapdog of
the kind that in most parts of the world only measures
seven inches from the end of his dear nose to the tip of his
darling tail&mdash;but in Rotundia he was bigger than I can possibly
expect you to believe. And when he barked, his bark
was so large that it filled up all the night and left no room
for sleep or dreams or polite conversation, or anything
else at all. He never barked at things that went on in the
island&mdash;he was too large-minded for that; but when ships
went blundering by in the dark, tumbling over the rocks
at the end of the island, he would bark once or twice, just
to let the ships know that they couldn't come playing
about there just as they liked.</p>

<p>But on this particular night he barked and barked and
barked&mdash;and the Princess said, "Oh dear, oh dear, I wish
he wouldn't, I am so sleepy." And Tom said to himself, "I
wonder whatever is the matter. As soon as it's light I'll go
and see."</p>

<p>So when it began to be pretty pink-and-yellow daylight,
Tom got up and went out. And all the time the Mexican
lapdog barked so that the houses shook, and the tiles on
the roof of the palace rattled like milk cans in a cart whose
horse is frisky.</p>

<p>"I'll go to the pillar," thought Tom, as he went through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the town. The pillar, of course, was the top of the piece of
rock that had stuck itself through Rotundia millions of
years before, and made it spin around the wrong way. It
was quite in the middle of the island, and stuck up ever so
far, and when you were at the top you could see a great
deal farther than when you were not.</p>

<p>As Tom went out from the town and across the downs,
he thought what a pretty sight it was to see the rabbits in
the bright, dewy morning, frisking with their young ones
by the mouths of their burrows. He did not go very near
the rabbits, of course, because when a rabbit of that size
is at play it does not always look where it is going, and it
might easily have crushed Tom with its foot, and then it
would have been very sorry afterward. And Tom was a
kind boy, and would not have liked to make even a rabbit
unhappy. Earwigs in our country often get out of the way
when they think you are going to walk on them. They too
have kind hearts, and they would not like you to be sorry
afterward.</p>

<p>So Tom went on, looking at the rabbits and watching
the morning grow more and more red and golden. And the
Mexican lapdog barked all the time, till the church bells
tinkled, and the chimney of the apple factory rocked
again.</p>

<p>But when Tom got to the pillar, he saw that he would
not need to climb to the top to find out what the dog was
barking at.</p>

<p>For there, by the pillar, lay a very large purple dragon.
His wings were like old purple umbrellas that have been
very much rained on, and his head was large and bald,
like the top of a purple toadstool, and his tail, which was
purple too, was very, very, very long and thin and tight,
like the lash of a carriage whip.</p>

<p>It was licking one of its purple umbrella-y wings, and
every now and then it moaned and leaned its head back
against the rocky pillar as though it felt faint. Tom saw at
once what had happened. A flight of purple dragons must
have crossed the island in the night, and this poor one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
must have knocked its wing and broken it against the
pillar.</p>

<p>Everyone is kind to everyone in Rotundia, and Tom was
not afraid of the dragon, although he had never spoken to
one before. He had often watched them flying across the
sea, but he had never expected to get to know one
personally.</p>

<p>So now he said: "I am afraid you don't feel quite well."</p>

<p>The dragon shook his large purple head. He could not
speak, but like all other animals, he could understand well
enough when he liked.</p>

<p>"Can I get you anything?" asked Tom, politely.</p>

<p>The dragon opened his purple eyes with an inquiring
smile.</p>

<p>"A bun or two, now," said Tom, coaxingly. "There's a
beautiful bun tree quite close."</p>

<p>The dragon opened a great purple mouth and licked his
purple lips, so Tom ran and shook the bun tree, and soon
came back with an armful of fresh currant buns, and as he
came he picked a few of the Bath kind, which grow on the
low bushes near the pillar.</p>

<p>Because, of course, another consequence of the
island's having spun the wrong way is that all the things
we have to make&mdash;buns and cakes and shortbread&mdash;grow
on trees and bushes, but in Rotundia they have to make
their cauliflowers and cabbages and carrots and apples
and onions, just as our cooks make puddings and
turnovers.</p>

<p>Tom gave all the buns to the dragon, saying: "Here, try
to eat a little. You'll soon feel better then."</p>

<p>The dragon ate up the buns, nodded rather ungraciously,
and began to lick his wing again. So Tom left him
and went back to the town with the news, and everyone
was so excited at a real live dragon's being on the island&mdash;a
thing that had never happened before&mdash;that they all
went out to look at it, instead of going to the prize-giving,
and the Lord Chief Schoolmaster went with the rest. Now,
he had Tom's prize, the <i>History of Rotundia</i>, in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
pocket&mdash;the one bound in calf, with the Royal arms on the
cover&mdash;and it happened to drop out, and the dragon ate
it, so Tom never got the prize after all. But the dragon,
when he had gotten it, did not like it.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's all for the best," said Tom. "I might not
have liked that prize either, if I had gotten it."</p>

<p>It happened to be a Wednesday, so when the Princess's
friends were asked what they would like to do, all the little
dukes and marquises and earls said, "Let's go and see
the dragon." But the little duchesses and marchionesses
and countesses said they were afraid.</p>

<p>Then Princess Mary Ann spoke up royally, and said,
"Don't be silly, because it's only in fairy stories and histories
of England and things like that, that people are unkind
and want to hurt each other. In Rotundia everyone is kind,
and no one has anything to be afraid of, unless they're
naughty; and then we know it's for our own good. Let's all
go and see the dragon. We might take him some acid
drops." So they went. And all the titled children took it in
turns to feed the dragon with acid drops, and he seemed
pleased and flattered, and wagged as much of his purple
tail as he could get at conveniently; for it was a very, very
long tail indeed. But when it came to the Princess's turn
to give an acid drop to the dragon, he smiled a very wide
smile, and wagged his tail to the very last long inch of it,
as much as to say, "Oh, you nice, kind, pretty little
Princess." But deep down in his wicked purple heart he
was saying, "Oh, you nice, fat, pretty little Princess, I
should like to eat you instead of these silly acid drops."
But of course nobody heard him except the Princess's
uncle, and he was a magician, and accustomed to listening
at doors. It was part of his trade.</p>

<p>Now, you will remember that I told you there was one
wicked person in Rotundia, and I cannot conceal from you
any longer that this Complete Bad was the Princess's
Uncle James. Magicians are always bad, as you know from
your fairy books, and some uncles are bad, as you see by
the <i>Babes in the Wood</i>, or the <i>Norfolk Tragedy</i>, and one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
James at least was bad, as you have learned from your
English history. And when anyone is a magician, and is
also an uncle, and is named James as well, you need not
expect anything nice from him. He is a Threefold
Complete Bad&mdash;and he will come to no good.</p>

<p>Uncle James had long wanted to get rid of the Princess
and have the kingdom to himself. He did not like many
things&mdash;a nice kingdom was almost the only thing he
cared for&mdash;but he had never seen his way quite clearly,
because everyone is so kind in Rotundia that wicked
spells will not work there, but run off those blameless
islanders like water off a duck's back. Now, however,
Uncle James thought there might be a chance for him&mdash;because
he knew that now there were two wicked people
on the island who could stand by each other&mdash;himself
and the dragon. He said nothing, but he exchanged a
meaningful glance with the dragon, and everyone went
home to tea. And no one had seen the meaningful glance
except Tom.</p>

<p>Tom went home, and told his elephant all about it. The
intelligent little creature listened carefully, and then
climbed from Tom's knee to the table, on which stood an
ornamental calendar that the Princess had given Tom for
a Christmas present. With its tiny trunk the elephant
pointed out a date&mdash;the fifteenth of August, the Princess's
birthday, and looked anxiously at its master.</p>

<p>"What is it, Fido&mdash;good little elephant&mdash;then?" said
Tom, and the sagacious animal repeated its former gesture.
Then Tom understood.</p>

<p>"Oh, something is to happen on her birthday? All right.
I'll be on the lookout." And he was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/gs06.jpg" width="300" height="341" alt="&quot;By-and-by he began to wander.&quot; See page 29." title="&quot;By-and-by he began to wander.&quot; See page 29." />
<span class="caption">&quot;By-and-by he began to wander.&quot;<br /><a href="#Page_29"><i>See page 29.</i></a></span>
</div>

<p>At first the people of Rotundia were quite pleased with
the dragon, who lived by the pillar and fed himself from
the bun trees, but by-and-by he began to wander. He
would creep into the burrows made by the great rabbits;
and excursionists, sporting on the downs, would see his
long, tight, whiplike tail wriggling down a burrow and out
of sight, and before they had time to say, "There he goes,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
his ugly purple head would come poking out from another
rabbit-hole&mdash;perhaps just behind them&mdash;or laugh softly
to itself just in their ears. And the dragon's laugh was not
a merry one. This sort of hide-and-seek amused people at
first, but by-and-by it began to get on their nerves: and if
you don't know what that means, ask Mother to tell you
next time you are playing blind man's buff when she has a
headache. Then the dragon got into the habit of cracking
his tail, as people crack whips, and this also got on people's
nerves. Then, too, little things began to be missed.
And you know how unpleasant that is, even in a private
school, and in a public kingdom it is, of course, much
worse. The things that were missed were nothing much at
first&mdash;a few little elephants, a hippopotamus or two, and
some giraffes, and things like that. It was nothing much,
as I say, but it made people feel uncomfortable. Then one
day a favorite rabbit of the Princess's, called Frederick,
mysteriously disappeared, and then came a terrible morning
when the Mexican lapdog was missing. He had barked
ever since the dragon came to the island, and people had
grown quite used to the noise. So when his barking suddenly
ceased it woke everybody up&mdash;and they all went
out to see what was the matter. And the lapdog was gone!</p>

<p>A boy was sent to wake the army, so that it might look
for him. But the army was gone too! And now the people
began to be frightened. Then Uncle James came out onto
the terrace of the palace, and he made the people a
speech. He said: "Friends&mdash;fellow citizens&mdash;I cannot disguise
from myself or from you that this purple dragon is a
poor penniless exile, a helpless alien in our midst, and,
besides, he is a&mdash;is no end of a dragon."</p>

<p>The people thought of the dragon's tail and said, "Hear,
hear."</p>

<p>Uncle James went on: "Something has happened to a
gentle and defenseless member of our community. We
don't know what has happened."</p>

<p>Everyone thought of the rabbit named Frederick, and
groaned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"The defenses of our country have been swallowed up,"
said Uncle James.</p>

<p>Everyone thought of the poor army.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing to be done." Uncle James was
warming to his subject. "Could we ever forgive ourselves
if by neglecting a simple precaution we lost more rabbits&mdash;or
even, perhaps, our navy, our police, and our fire
brigade? For I warn you that the purple dragon will
respect nothing, however sacred."</p>

<p>Everyone thought of themselves&mdash;and they said, "What
is the simple precaution?"</p>

<p>Then Uncle James said: "Tomorrow is the dragon's
birthday. He is accustomed to have a present on his birthday.
If he gets a nice present he will be in a hurry to take
it away and show it to his friends, and he will fly off and
never come back."</p>

<p>The crowd cheered wildly&mdash;and the Princess from her
balcony clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"The present the dragon expects," said Uncle James,
cheerfully, "is rather an expensive one. But, when we give,
it should not be in a grudging spirit, especially to visitors.
What the dragon wants is a Princess. We have only one
Princess, it is true; but far be it from us to display a miserly
temper at such a moment. And the gift is worthless
that costs the giver nothing. Your readiness to give up
your Princess will only show how generous you are."</p>

<p>The crowd began to cry, for they loved their Princess,
though they quite saw that their first duty was to be generous
and give the poor dragon what it wanted.</p>

<p>The Princess began to cry, for she did not want to be
anybody's birthday present&mdash;especially a purple dragon's.
And Tom began to cry because he was so angry.</p>

<p>He went straight home and told his little elephant; and
the elephant cheered him up so much that presently the
two grew quite absorbed in a top that the elephant was
spinning with his little trunk.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Tom went to the palace. He looked
out across the downs&mdash;there were hardly any rabbits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
playing there now&mdash;and then he gathered white roses and
threw them at the Princess's window till she woke up and
looked out.</p>

<p>"Come up and kiss me," she said.</p>

<p>So Tom climbed up the white rosebush and kissed the
Princess through the window, and said: "Many happy
returns of the day."</p>

<p>Then Mary Ann began to cry, and said: "Oh, Tom&mdash;how
can you? When you know quite well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't," said Tom. "Why, Mary Ann, my precious,
my Princess&mdash;what do you think I should be doing while
the dragon was getting his birthday present? Don't cry,
my own little Mary Ann! Fido and I have arranged everything.
You've only got to do as you are told."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said the Princess. "Oh&mdash;that's easy&mdash;I've
often done that!"</p>

<p>Then Tom told her what she was to do. And she kissed
him again and again. "Oh, you dear, good, clever Tom,"
she said. "How glad I am that I gave you Fido. You two
have saved me. You dears!"</p>

<p>The next morning Uncle James put on his best coat and
hat and the vest with the gold snakes on it&mdash;he was a
magician, and he had a bright taste in vests&mdash;and he
called with a cab to take the Princess out.</p>

<p>"Come, little birthday present," he said tenderly. "The
dragon will be so pleased. And I'm glad to see you're not
crying. You know, my child, we cannot begin too young to
learn to think of the happiness of others rather than our
own. I should not like my dear little niece to be selfish, or
to wish to deny a trivial pleasure to a poor, sick dragon,
far from his home and friends."</p>

<p>The Princess said she would try not to be selfish.</p>

<p>Presently the cab drew up near the pillar, and there was
the dragon, his ugly purple head shining in the sun, and
his ugly purple mouth half open.</p>

<p>Uncle James said: "Good morning, sir. We have brought
you a small present for your birthday. We do not like to
let such an anniversary go by without some suitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
testimonial, especially to one who is a stranger in our
midst. Our means are small, but our hearts are large. We
have but one Princess, but we give her freely&mdash;do we not,
my child?"</p>

<p>The Princess said she supposed so, and the dragon
came a little nearer.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice cried: "Run!" and there was Tom, and
he had brought the Zoological guinea pig and a pair of
Belgian hares with him. "Just to see fair," said Tom.</p>

<p>Uncle James was furious. "What do you mean, sir," he
cried, "by intruding on a State function with your common
rabbits and things? Go away, naughty little boy, and play
with them somewhere else."</p>

<p>But while he was speaking the rabbits had come up one
on each side of him, their great sides towering ever so
high, and now they pressed him between them so that he
was buried in their thick fur and almost choked. The
Princess, meantime, had run to the other side of the pillar
and was peeping around it to see what was going on. A
crowd had followed the cab out of the town; now they
reached the scene of the "State Function"&mdash;and they all
cried out: "Fair play&mdash;play fair! We can't go back on our
word like this. Give a thing and take a thing? Why, it's
never done. Let the poor exiled stranger dragon have his
birthday present." And they tried to get at Tom&mdash;but the
guinea pig stood in the way.</p>

<p>"Yes," Tom cried. "Fair play is a jewel. And your helpless
exile shall have the Princess&mdash;if he can catch her.
Now then, Mary Ann."</p>

<p>Mary Ann looked around the big pillar and called to the
dragon: "Bo! you can't catch me," and began to run as fast
as ever she could, and the dragon ran after her. When the
Princess had run a half mile she stopped, dodged around
a tree, and ran back to the pillar and around it, and the
dragon after her. You see, he was so long he could not
turn as quickly as she could. Around and around the pillar
ran the Princess. The first time she ran around a long
way from the pillar, and then nearer and nearer&mdash;with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
dragon after her all the time; and he was so busy trying to
catch her that he never noticed that Tom had tied the
very end of his long, tight, whipcordy tail to the rock, so
that the more the dragon ran around, the more times he
twisted his tail around the pillar. It was exactly like winding
a top&mdash;only the peg was the pillar, and the dragon's
tail was the string. And the magician was safe between the
Belgian hares, and couldn't see anything but darkness, or
do anything but choke.</p>

<p>When the dragon was wound onto the pillar as much as
he possibly could be, and as tight&mdash;like cotton on a reel&mdash;the
Princess stopped running, and though she had very
little breath left, she managed to say, "Yah&mdash;who's won
now?"</p>

<p>This annoyed the dragon so much that he put out all his
strength&mdash;spread his great purple wings, and tried to fly
at her. Of course this pulled his tail, and pulled it very
hard, so hard that as he pulled the tail <i>had</i> to come, and
the pillar <i>had</i> to come around with the tail, and the island
<i>had</i> to come around with the pillar, and in another minute
the tail was loose, and the island was spinning around
exactly like a top. It spun so fast that everyone fell flat on
their faces and held on tight to themselves, because they
felt something was going to happen. All but the magician,
who was choking between the Belgian hares, and felt
nothing but fur and fury.</p>

<p>And something did happen. The dragon had sent the
kingdom of Rotundia spinning the way it ought to have
gone at the beginning of the world, and as it spun around,
all the animals began to change sizes. The guinea pigs got
small, and the elephants got big, and the men and women
and children would have changed sizes too, if they had
not had the sense to hold on to themselves, very tight
indeed, with both hands; which, of course, the animals
could not be expected to know how to do. And the best of
it was that when the small beasts got big and the big
beasts got small the dragon got small too, and fell at the
Princess's feet&mdash;a little, crawling, purple newt with wings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Funny little thing," said the Princess, when she saw it.
"I will take it for a birthday present."</p>

<p>But while all the people were still on their faces, holding
on tight to themselves, Uncle James, the magician,
never thought of holding tight&mdash;he only thought of how to
punish Belgian hares and the sons of gardeners; so when
the big beasts grew small, he grew small with the other
beasts, and the little purple dragon, when he fell at the
Princess's feet, saw there a very small magician named
Uncle James. And the dragon took him because it wanted
a birthday present.</p>

<p>So now all the animals were new sizes&mdash;and at first it
seemed very strange to everyone to have great lumbering
elephants and a tiny little dormouse, but they have gotten
used to it now, and think no more of it than we do.</p>

<p>All this happened several years ago, and the other day
I saw in the <i>Rotundia Times</i> an account of the wedding of
the Princess with Lord Thomas Gardener, K.C.D., and I
knew she could not have married anyone but Tom, so I
suppose they made him a Lord on purpose for the wedding&mdash;and
<i>K.C.D.</i>, of course, means Clever Conqueror of
the Dragon. If you think that is wrong it is only because
you don't know how they spell in Rotundia. The paper
said that among the beautiful presents of the bridegroom
to the bride was an enormous elephant, on which the
bridal pair made their wedding tour. This must have been
Fido. You remember Tom promised to give him back to
the Princess when they were married. The <i>Rotundia Times</i>
called the married couple "the happy pair." It was clever
of the paper to think of calling them that&mdash;it is such a
pretty and novel expression, and I think it is truer than
many of the things you see in papers.</p>

<p>Because, you see, the Princess and the gardener's son
were so fond of each other they could not help being
happy&mdash;and besides, they had an elephant of their very
own to ride on. If that is not enough to make people
happy, I should like to know what is. Though, of course, I
know there are some people who could not be happy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
unless they had a whale to sail on, and perhaps not even
then. But they are greedy, grasping people, the kind who
would take four helps of pudding, as likely as not, which
neither Tom nor Mary Ann ever did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<h2>III. The Deliverers of Their Country</h2>


<p>It all began with Effie's getting something in her eye. It
hurt very much indeed, and it felt something like a red-hot
spark&mdash;only it seemed to have legs as well, and wings
like a fly. Effie rubbed and cried&mdash;not real crying, but the
kind your eye does all by itself without your being miserable
inside your mind&mdash;and then she went to her father to
have the thing in her eye taken out. Effie's father was a
doctor, so of course he knew how to take things out of
eyes&mdash;he did it very cleverly with a soft paintbrush
dipped in castor oil.</p>

<p>When he had gotten the thing out, he said: "This is very
curious." Effie had often got things in her eye before, and
her father had always seemed to think it was natural&mdash;rather
tiresome and naughty perhaps, but still natural. He
had never before thought it curious.</p>

<p>Effie stood holding her handkerchief to her eye, and
said: "I don't believe it's out." People always say this when
they have had something in their eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;it's out," said the doctor. "Here it is, on the
brush. This is very interesting."</p>

<p>Effie had never heard her father say that about anything
that she had any share in. She said: "What?"</p>

<p>The doctor carried the brush very carefully across the
room, and held the point of it under his microscope&mdash;then
he twisted the brass screws of the microscope, and
looked through the top with one eye.</p>

<p>"Dear me," he said. "Dear, dear me! Four well-developed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
limbs; a long caudal appendage; five toes, unequal in
lengths, almost like one of the <i>Lacertidae</i>, yet there are
traces of wings." The creature under his eye wriggled a
little in the castor oil, and he went on: "Yes; a batlike wing.
A new specimen, undoubtedly. Effie, run round to the professor
and ask him to be kind enough to step in for a few
minutes."</p>

<p>"You might give me sixpence, Daddy," said Effie,
"because I did bring you the new specimen. I took great
care of it inside my eye, and my eye <i>does</i> hurt."</p>

<p>The doctor was so pleased with the new specimen that
he gave Effie a shilling, and presently the professor
stepped round. He stayed to lunch, and he and the doctor
quarreled very happily all the afternoon about the name
and the family of the thing that had come out of Effie's eye.</p>

<p>But at teatime another thing happened. Effie's brother
Harry fished something out of his tea, which he thought
at first was an earwig. He was just getting ready to drop it
on the floor, and end its life in the usual way, when it
shook itself in the spoon&mdash;spread two wet wings, and
flopped onto the tablecloth. There it sat, stroking itself
with its feet and stretching its wings, and Harry said:
"Why, it's a tiny newt!"</p>

<p>The professor leaned forward before the doctor could
say a word. "I'll give you half a crown for it, Harry, my lad,"
he said, speaking very fast; and then he picked it up carefully
on his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"It is a new specimen," he said, "and finer than yours,
Doctor."</p>

<p>It was a tiny lizard, about half an inch long&mdash;with scales
and wings.</p>

<p>So now the doctor and the professor each had a specimen,
and they were both very pleased. But before long
these specimens began to seem less valuable. For the
next morning, when the knife-boy was cleaning the doctor's
boots, he suddenly dropped the brushes and the
boot and the blacking, and screamed out that he was
burnt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>And from inside the boot came crawling a lizard as big
as a kitten, with large, shiny wings.</p>

<p>"Why," said Effie, "I know what it is. It is a dragon like
the one St. George killed."</p>

<p>And Effie was right. That afternoon Towser was bitten
in the garden by a dragon about the size of a rabbit, which
he had tried to chase, and the next morning all the papers
were full of the wonderful "winged lizards" that were
appearing all over the country. The papers would not call
them dragons, because, of course, no one believes in
dragons nowadays&mdash;and at any rate the papers were not
going to be so silly as to believe in fairy stories. At first
there were only a few, but in a week or two the country
was simply running alive with dragons of all sizes, and in
the air you could sometimes see them as thick as a swarm
of bees. They all looked alike except as to size. They were
green with scales, and they had four legs and a long tail
and great wings like bats' wings, only the wings were
a pale, half-transparent yellow, like the gear-boxes on
bicycles.</p>

<p>They breathed fire and smoke, as all proper dragons
must, but still the newspapers went on pretending they
were lizards, until the editor of the <i>Standard</i> was picked
up and carried away by a very large one, and then the
other newspaper people had not anyone left to tell them
what they ought not to believe. So when the largest elephant
in the Zoo was carried off by a dragon, the papers
gave up pretending&mdash;and put <span class="smcap">Alarming Plague of Dragons</span>
at the top of the paper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>You have no idea how alarming it was, and at the same
time how aggravating. The large-size dragons were terrible
certainly, but when once you had found out that the
dragons always went to bed early because they were
afraid of the chill night air, you had only to stay indoors
all day, and you were pretty safe from the big ones. But
the smaller sizes were a perfect nuisance. The ones as big
as earwigs got in the soap, and they got in the butter. The
ones as big as dogs got in the bath, and the fire and smoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
inside them made them steam like anything when the cold
water tap was turned on, so that careless people were
often scalded quite severely. The ones that were as large
as pigeons would get into workbaskets or corner drawers
and bite you when you were in a hurry to get a needle or
a handkerchief. The ones as big as sheep were easier to
avoid, because you could see them coming; but when
they flew in at the windows and curled up under your
eiderdown, and you did not find them till you went to bed,
it was always a shock. The ones this size did not eat
people, only lettuce, but they always scorched the sheets
and pillowcases dreadfully.</p>

<p>Of course, the County Council and the police did everything
that could be done: It was no use offering the hand
of the Princess to anyone who killed a dragon. This way
was all very well in olden times&mdash;when there was only one
dragon and one Princess; but now there were far more
dragons than Princesses&mdash;although the Royal Family was
a large one. And besides, it would have been a mere waste
of Princesses to offer rewards for killing dragons, because
everybody killed as many dragons as they could quite out
of their own heads and without rewards at all, just to get
the nasty things out of the way. The County Council
undertook to cremate all dragons delivered at their
offices between the hours of ten and two, and whole wagonloads
and cartloads and truckloads of dead dragons
could be seen any day of the week standing in a long line
in the street where the County Council had their offices.
Boys brought barrowloads of dead dragons, and children
on their way home from morning school would call in to
leave the handful or two of little dragons they had
brought in their satchels, or carried in their knotted
pocket handkerchiefs. And yet there seemed to be as
many dragons as ever. Then the police stuck up great
wood and canvas towers covered with patent glue. When
the dragons flew against these towers, they stuck fast, as
flies and wasps do on the sticky papers in the kitchen; and
when the towers were covered all over with dragons, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
police inspector used to set fire to the towers, and burnt
them and dragons and all.</p>

<p>And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever.
The shops were full of patent dragon poison and anti-dragon
soap, and dragonproof curtains for the windows;
and indeed, everything that could be done was done.</p>

<p>And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever.</p>

<p>It was not very easy to know what would poison a dragon,
because, you see, they ate such different things. The
largest kind ate elephants as long as there were any, and
then went on with horses and cows. Another size ate
nothing but lilies of the valley, and a third size ate only
Prime Ministers if they were to be had, and, if not, would
feed freely on servants in livery. Another size lived on
bricks, and three of them ate two thirds of the South
Lambeth Infirmary in one afternoon.</p>

<p>But the size Effie was most afraid of was about as big as
your dining room, and that size ate little girls and boys.</p>

<p>At first Effie and her brother were quite pleased with
the change in their lives. It was so amusing to sit up all
night instead of going to sleep, and to play in the garden
lighted by electric lamps. And it sounded so funny to hear
Mother say, when they were going to bed: "Good night,
my darlings, sleep sound all day, and don't get up too
soon. You must not get up before it's quite dark. You
wouldn't like the nasty dragons to catch you."</p>

<p>But after a time they got very tired of it all: They wanted
to see the flowers and trees growing in the fields, and
to see the pretty sunshine out of doors, and not just
through glass windows and patent dragonproof curtains.
And they wanted to play on the grass, which they were
not allowed to do in the electric lamp-lighted garden
because of the night-dew.</p>

<p>And they wanted so much to get out, just for once, in
the beautiful, bright, dangerous daylight, that they began
to try and think of some reason why they ought to go out.
Only they did not like to disobey their mother.</p>

<p>But one morning their mother was busy preparing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
some new dragon poison to lay down in the cellars, and
their father was bandaging the hand of the boot boy,
which had been scratched by one of the dragons who
liked to eat Prime Ministers when they were to be had, so
nobody remembered to say to the children: "Don't get up
till it is quite dark!"</p>

<p>"Go now," said Harry. "It would not be disobedient to
go. And I know exactly what we ought to do, but I don't
know how we ought to do it."</p>

<p>"What ought we to do?" said Effie.</p>

<p>"We ought to wake St. George, of course," said Harry.
"He was the only person in his town who knew how to
manage dragons; the people in the fairy tales don't count.
But St. George is a real person, and he is only asleep, and
he is waiting to be waked up. Only nobody believes in St.
George now. I heard father say so."</p>

<p>"We do," said Effie.</p>

<p>"Of course we do. And don't you see, Ef, that's the very
reason why we could wake him? You can't wake people if
you don't believe in them, can you?"</p>

<p>Effie said no, but where could they find St. George?</p>

<p>"We must go and look," said Harry boldly. "You shall
wear a dragonproof frock, made of stuff like the curtains.
And I will smear myself all over with the best dragon poison,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Effie clasped her hands and skipped with joy and cried:
"Oh, Harry! I know where we can find St. George! In St.
George's Church, of course."</p>

<p>"Um," said Harry, wishing he had thought of it for himself,
"you have a little sense sometimes, for a girl."</p>

<p>So the next afternoon, quite early, long before the
beams of sunset announced the coming night, when
everybody would be up and working, the two children got
out of bed. Effie wrapped herself in a shawl of dragonproof
muslin&mdash;there was no time to make the frock&mdash;and
Harry made a horrid mess of himself with the patent dragon
poison. It was warranted harmless to infants and
invalids, so he felt quite safe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they joined hands and set out to walk to St.
George's Church. As you know, there are many St.
George's churches, but fortunately they took the turning
that leads to the right one, and went along in the bright
sunlight, feeling very brave and adventurous.</p>

<p>There was no one about in the streets except dragons,
and the place was simply swarming with them.
Fortunately none of the dragons were just the right size
for eating little boys and girls, or perhaps this story might
have had to end here. There were dragons on the pavement,
and dragons on the roadway, dragons basking on
the front doorsteps of public buildings, and dragons
preening their wings on the roofs in the hot afternoon
sun. The town was quite green with them. Even when the
children had gotten out of the town and were walking in
the lanes, they noticed that the fields on each side were
greener than usual with the scaly legs and tails; and some
of the smaller sizes had made themselves asbestos nests
in the flowering hawthorn hedges.</p>

<p>Effie held her brother's hand very tight, and once when
a fat dragon flopped against her ear she screamed out,
and a whole flight of green dragons rose from the field at
the sound, and sprawled away across the sky. The children
could hear the rattle of their wings as they flew.</p>

<p>"Oh, I want to go home," said Effie.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," said Harry. "Surely you haven't forgotten
about the Seven Champions and all the princes.
People who are going to be their country's deliverers
never scream and say they want to go home."</p>

<p>"And are we," asked Effie&mdash;"deliverers, I mean?"</p>

<p>"You'll see," said her brother, and on they went.</p>

<p>When they came to St. George's Church they found the
door open, and they walked right in&mdash;but St. George was
not there, so they walked around the churchyard outside,
and presently they found the great stone tomb of St.
George, with the figure of him carved in marble outside, in
his armor and helmet, and with his hands folded on his
breast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"How ever can we wake him?" they said. Then Harry
spoke to St. George&mdash;but he would not answer; and he
called, but St. George did not seem to hear; and then he
actually tried to waken the great dragon-slayer by shaking
his marble shoulders. But St. George took no notice.</p>

<p>Then Effie began to cry, and she put her arms around
St. George's neck as well as she could for the marble,
which was very much in the way at the back, and she
kissed the marble face, and she said: "Oh, dear, good, kind
St. George, please wake up and help us."</p>

<p>And at that St. George opened his eyes sleepily, and
stretched himself and said: "What's the matter, little girl?"</p>

<p>So the children told him all about it; he turned over in
his marble and leaned on one elbow to listen. But when he
heard that there were so many dragons he shook his
head.</p>

<p>"It's no good," he said, "they would be one too many for
poor old George. You should have waked me before. I was
always for a fair fight&mdash;one man one dragon, was my
motto."</p>

<p>Just then a flight of dragons passed overhead, and St.
George half drew his sword.</p>

<p>But he shook his head again and pushed the sword
back as the flight of dragons grew small in the distance.</p>

<p>"I can't do anything," he said. "Things have changed
since my time. St. Andrew told me about it. They woke
him up over the engineers' strike, and he came to talk to
me. He says everything is done by machinery now; there
must be some way of settling these dragons. By the way,
what sort of weather have you been having lately?"</p>

<p>This seemed so careless and unkind that Harry would
not answer, but Effie said patiently, "It has been very fine.
Father says it is the hottest weather there has ever been
in this country."</p>

<p>"Ah, I guessed as much," said the Champion, thoughtfully.
"Well, the only thing would be ... dragons can't
stand wet and cold, that's the only thing. If you could find
the taps."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>St. George was beginning to settle down again on his
stone slab.</p>

<p>"Good night, very sorry I can't help you," he said, yawning
behind his marble hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you can," cried Effie. "Tell us&mdash;what taps?"</p>

<p>"Oh, like in the bathroom," said St. George, still more
sleepily. "And there's a looking glass, too; shows you all
the world and what's going on. St. Denis told me about it;
said it was a very pretty thing. I'm sorry I can't&mdash;good
night."</p>

<p>And he fell back into his marble and was fast asleep
again in a moment.</p>

<p>"We shall never find the taps," said Harry. "I say,
wouldn't it be awful if St. George woke up when there was
a dragon near, the size that eats champions?"</p>

<p>Effie pulled off her dragonproof veil. "We didn't meet
any the size of the dining room as we came along," she
said. "I daresay we shall be quite safe."</p>

<p>So she covered St. George with the veil, and Harry
rubbed off as much as he could of the dragon poison onto
St. George's armor, so as to make everything quite safe for
him.</p>

<p>"We might hide in the church till it is dark," he said,
"and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at that moment a dark shadow fell on them, and
they saw that it was a dragon exactly the size of the dining
room at home.</p>

<p>So then they knew that all was lost. The dragon
swooped down and caught the two children in his claws;
he caught Effie by her green silk sash, and Harry by the little
point at the back of his Eton jacket&mdash;and then, spreading
his great yellow wings, he rose into the air, rattling like
a third-class carriage when the brake is hard on.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry," said Effie, "I wonder when he will eat us!"
The dragon was flying across woods and fields with great
flaps of his wings that carried him a quarter of a mile at
each flap.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/gs10.jpg" width="284" height="400" alt="&quot;He rose into the air, rattling like a third-class carriage.&quot; See page 50." title="&quot;He rose into the air, rattling like a third-class carriage.&quot; See page 50." />
<span class="caption">&quot;He rose into the air, rattling like a third-class carriage.&quot;<br /><a href="#Page_50"><i>See page 50.</i></a></span>
</div>

<p>Harry and Effie could see the country below, hedges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and rivers and churches and farmhouses flowing away
from under them, much faster than you see them running
away from the sides of the fastest express train.</p>

<p>And still the dragon flew on. The children saw other
dragons in the air as they went, but the dragon who was
as big as the dining room never stopped to speak to any
of them, but just flew on quite steadily.</p>

<p>"He knows where he wants to go," said Harry. "Oh, if he
would only drop us before he gets there!"</p>

<p>But the dragon held on tight, and he flew and flew and
flew until at last, when the children were quite giddy, he
settled down, with a rattling of all his scales, on the top of
a mountain. And he lay there on his great green scaly side,
panting, and very much out of breath, because he had
come such a long way. But his claws were fast in Effie's
sash and the little point at the back of Harry's Eton jacket.</p>

<p>Then Effie took out the knife Harry had given her on her
birthday. It had cost only sixpence to begin with, and she
had had it a month, and it never could sharpen anything
but slate-pencils; but somehow she managed to make that
knife cut her sash in front, and crept out of it, leaving the
dragon with only a green silk bow in one of his claws. That
knife would never have cut Harry's jacket-tail off, though,
and when Effie had tried for some time she saw that this
was so and gave it up. But with her help Harry managed
to wriggle quietly out of his sleeves, so that the dragon
had only an Eton jacket in his other claw. Then the children
crept on tiptoe to a crack in the rocks and got in. It
was much too narrow for the dragon to get in also, so they
stayed in there and waited to make faces at the dragon
when he felt rested enough to sit up and begin to think
about eating them. He was very angry, indeed, when they
made faces at him, and blew out fire and smoke at them,
but they ran farther into the cave so that he could not
reach them, and when he was tired of blowing he went
away.</p>

<p>But they were afraid to come out of the cave, so they
went farther in, and presently the cave opened out and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
grew bigger, and the floor was soft sand, and when they
had come to the very end of the cave there was a door,
and on it was written: <span class="smcap">Universal Taproom. Private. No one
allowed inside.</span></p>

<p>So they opened the door at once just to peep in, and
then they remembered what St. George had said.</p>

<p>"We can't be worse off than we are," said Harry, "with a
dragon waiting for us outside. Let's go in."</p>

<p>They went boldly into the taproom, and shut the door
behind them.</p>

<p>And now they were in a sort of room cut out of the solid
rock, and all along one side of the room were taps, and all
the taps were labeled with china labels like you see in
baths. And as they could both read words of two syllables
or even three sometimes, they understood at once that
they had gotten to the place where the weather is turned
on from. There were six big taps labeled "Sunshine,"
"Wind," "Rain," "Snow," "Hail," "Ice," and a lot of little
ones, labeled "Fair to moderate," "Showery," "South
breeze," "Nice growing weather for the crops," "Skating,"
"Good open weather," "South wind," "East wind," and so
on. And the big tap labeled "Sunshine" was turned full on.
They could not see any sunshine&mdash;the cave was lighted
by a skylight of blue glass&mdash;so they supposed the sunlight
was pouring out by some other way, as it does with the
tap that washes out the underneath parts of patent sinks
in kitchens.</p>

<p>Then they saw that one side of the room was just a big
looking glass, and when you looked in it you could see
everything that was going on in the world&mdash;and all at
once, too, which is not like most looking glasses. They
saw the carts delivering the dead dragons at the County
Council offices, and they saw St. George asleep under the
dragonproof veil. And they saw their mother at home crying
because her children had gone out in the dreadful,
dangerous daylight, and she was afraid a dragon had
eaten them. And they saw the whole of England, like a
great puzzle map&mdash;green in the field parts and brown in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the towns, and black in the places where they make coal
and crockery and cutlery and chemicals. All over it, on
the black parts, and on the brown, and on the green, there
was a network of green dragons. And they could see that
it was still broad daylight, and no dragons had gone to
bed yet.</p>

<p>Effie said, "Dragons do not like cold." And she tried to
turn off the sunshine, but the tap was out of order, and
that was why there had been so much hot weather, and
why the dragons had been able to be hatched. So they left
the sunshine tap alone, and they turned on the snow and
left the tap full on while they went to look in the glass.
There they saw the dragons running all sorts of ways like
ants if you are cruel enough to pour water into an ant-heap,
which, of course, you never are. And the snow fell
more and more.</p>

<p>Then Effie turned the rain tap quite full on, and presently
the dragons began to wriggle less, and by-and-by some
of them lay quite still, so the children knew the water had
put out the fires inside them, and they were dead. So then
they turned on the hail&mdash;only half on, for fear of breaking
people's windows&mdash;and after a while there were no more
dragons to be seen moving.</p>

<p>Then the children knew that they were indeed the deliverers
of their country.</p>

<p>"They will put up a monument to us," said Harry, "as
high as Nelson's! All the dragons are dead."</p>

<p>"I hope the one that was waiting outside for us is dead!"
said Effie. "And about the monument, Harry, I'm not so
sure. What can they do with such a lot of dead dragons?
It would take years and years to bury them, and they
could never be burnt now they are so soaking wet. I wish
the rain would wash them off into the sea."</p>

<p>But this did not happen, and the children began to feel
that they had not been so frightfully clever after all.</p>

<p>"I wonder what this old thing's for," said Harry. He had
found a rusty old tap, which seemed as though it had not
been used for ages. Its china label was quite coated over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with dirt and cobwebs. When Effie had cleaned it with a
bit of her skirt&mdash;for curiously enough both the children
had come out without pocket handkerchiefs&mdash;she found
that the label said "Waste."</p>

<p>"Let's turn it on," she said. "It might carry off the
dragons."</p>

<p>The tap was very stiff from not having been used for
such a long time, but together they managed to turn it on,
and then ran to the mirror to see what happened.</p>

<p>Already a great, round black hole had opened in the
very middle of the map of England, and the sides of the
map were tilting themselves up, so that the rain ran down
toward the hole.</p>

<p>"Oh, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!" cried Effie, and she hurried
back to the taps and turned on everything that
seemed wet. "Showery," "Good open weather," "Nice
growing weather for the crops," and even "South" and
"South-West," because she had heard her father say that
those winds brought rain.</p>

<p>And now the floods of rain were pouring down on the
country, and great sheets of water flowed toward the center
of the map, and cataracts of water poured into the
great round hole in the middle of the map, and the dragons
were being washed away and disappearing down the
waste pipe in great green masses and scattered green
shoals&mdash;single dragons and dragons by the dozen; of all
sizes, from the ones that carry off elephants down to the
ones that get in your tea.</p>

<p>Presently there was not a dragon left. So then they
turned off the tap named "Waste," and they half-turned off
the one labeled "Sunshine"&mdash;it was broken, so that they
could not turn it off altogether&mdash;and they turned on "Fair
to moderate" and "Showery" and both taps stuck, so that
they could not be turned off, which accounts for our
climate.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>How did they get home again? By the Snowdon railway
of course.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>And was the nation grateful? Well&mdash;the nation was very
wet. And by the time the nation had gotten dry again it
was interested in the new invention for toasting muffins
by electricity, and all the dragons were almost forgotten.
Dragons do not seem so important when they are dead
and gone, and, you know, there never was a reward
offered.</p>

<p>And what did Father and Mother say when Effie and
Harry got home?</p>

<p>My dear, that is the sort of silly question you children
always will ask. However, just for this once I don't mind
telling you.</p>

<p>Mother said: "Oh, my darlings, my darlings, you're
safe&mdash;you're safe! You naughty children&mdash;how could you
be so disobedient? Go to bed at once!"</p>

<p>And their father the doctor said: "I wish I had known
what you were going to do! I should have liked to preserve
a specimen. I threw away the one I got out of Effie's eye. I
intended to get a more perfect specimen. I did not anticipate
this immediate extinction of the species."</p>

<p>The professor said nothing, but he rubbed his hands.
He had kept his specimen&mdash;the one the size of an earwig
that he gave Harry half a crown for&mdash;and he has it to this
day.</p>

<p>You must get him to show it to you!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h2>IV. The Ice Dragon, or Do as You Are Told</h2>


<p>This is the tale of the wonders that befell on the
evening of the eleventh of December, when they did
what they were told not to do. You may think that you
know all the unpleasant things that could possibly happen
to you if you are disobedient, but there are some
things which even you do not know, and they did not
know them either.</p>

<p>Their names were George and Jane.</p>

<p>There were no fireworks that year on Guy Fawkes' Day,
because the heir to the throne was not well. He was cutting
his first tooth, and that is a very anxious time for any
person&mdash;even for a Royal one. He was really very poorly,
so that fireworks would have been in the worst possible
taste, even at Land's End or in the Isle of Man, whilst in
Forest Hill, which was the home of Jane and George, anything
of the kind was quite out of the question. Even the
Crystal Palace, empty-headed as it is, felt that this was no
time for Catherine-wheels.</p>

<p>But when the Prince had cut his tooth, rejoicings were
not only admissible but correct, and the eleventh of
December was proclaimed firework day. All the people
were most anxious to show their loyalty, and to enjoy
themselves at the same time. So there were fireworks and
torchlight processions, and set pieces at the Crystal
Palace, with "Blessings on our Prince" and "Long Live our
Royal Darling" in different-colored fires; and the most private
of boarding schools had a half holiday; and even the
children of plumbers and authors had tuppence each
given them to spend as they liked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>George and Jane had sixpence each&mdash;and they spent
the whole amount on a golden rain, which would not light
for ever so long, and when it did light went out almost at
once, so they had to look at the fireworks in the gardens
next door, and at the ones at the Crystal Palace, which
were very glorious indeed.</p>

<p>All their relations had colds in their heads, so Jane and
George were allowed to go out into the garden alone to let
off their firework. Jane had put on her fur cape and her
thick gloves, and her hood with the silver fox fur on it that
was made out of Mother's old muff; and George had his
overcoat with the three capes, and his comforter, and
Father's sealskin traveling cap with the pieces that come
down over your ears.</p>

<p>It was dark in the garden, but the fireworks all about
made it seem very gay, and though the children were cold
they were quite sure that they were enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>They got up on the fence at the end of the garden to see
better; and then they saw, very far away, where the edge
of the dark world is, a shining line of straight, beautiful
lights arranged in a row, as if they were the spears carried
by a fairy army.</p>

<p>"Oh, how pretty," said Jane. "I wonder what they are. It
looks as if the fairies were planting little shining baby
poplar trees and watering them with liquid light."</p>

<p>"Liquid fiddlestick!" said George. He had been to
school, so he knew that these were only the Aurora
Borealis, or Northern Lights. And he said so.</p>

<p>"But what is the Rory Bory what's-its-name?" asked
Jane. "Who lights it, and what's it there for?"</p>

<p>George had to own that he had not learned that.</p>

<p>"But I know," said he, "that it has something to do with
the Great Bear, and the Dipper, and the Plough, and
Charles's Wain."</p>

<p>"And what are they?" asked Jane.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're the surnames of some of the star families.
There goes a jolly rocket," answered George, and Jane felt
as if she almost understood about the star families.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The fairy spears of light twinkled and gleamed: They
were much prettier than the big, blaring, blazing bonfire
that was smoking and flaming and spluttering in the next-door-but-one
garden&mdash;prettier even than the colored fires
at the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>"I wish we could see them nearer," Jane said. "I wonder
if the star families are nice families&mdash;the kind that Mother
would like us to go to tea with, if we were little stars?"</p>

<p>"They aren't that sort of families at all, Silly," said her
brother, kindly trying to explain. "I only said 'families'
because a kid like you wouldn't have understood if I'd
said constel ... and, besides, I've forgotten the end of the
word. Anyway, the stars are all up in the sky, so you can't
go to tea with them."</p>

<p>"No," said Jane. "I said if we were little stars."</p>

<p>"But we aren't," said George.</p>

<p>"No," said Jane, with a sigh. "I know that. I'm not so stupid
as you think, George. But the Tory Bories are somewhere
at the edge. Couldn't we go and see them?"</p>

<p>"Considering you're eight, you haven't much sense."
George kicked his boots against the fencing to warm his
toes. "It's half the world away."</p>

<p>"It looks very near," said Jane, hunching up her shoulders
to keep her neck warm.</p>

<p>"They're close to the North Pole," said George. "Look
here&mdash;I don't care a straw about the Aurora Borealis, but
I shouldn't mind discovering the North Pole: It's awfully
difficult and dangerous, and then you come home and
write a book about it with a lot of pictures, and everybody
says how brave you are."</p>

<p>Jane got off the fence.</p>

<p>"Oh, George, <i>let's</i>," she said. "We shall never have such
a chance again&mdash;all alone by ourselves&mdash;and quite late,
too."</p>

<p>"I'd go right enough if it wasn't for you," George
answered gloomily, "but you know they always say I lead
you into mischief&mdash;and if we went to the North Pole
we should get our boots wet, as likely as not, and you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
remember what they said about not going on the grass."</p>

<p>"They said the <i>lawn</i>," said Jane. "We're not going on the
<i>lawn</i>. Oh, George, do, do let's. It doesn't look so <i>very</i> far&mdash;we
could be back before they had time to get dreadfully
angry."</p>

<p>"All right," said George, "but mind, I don't want to go."</p>

<p>So off they went. They got over the fence, which was
very cold and white and shiny because it was beginning to
freeze, and on the other side of the fence was somebody
else's garden, so they got out of that as quickly as they
could, and beyond that was a field where there was another
big bonfire, with people standing around it who
looked quite dark-skinned.</p>

<p>"It's like Indians," said George, and wanted to stop and
look, but Jane pulled him on, and they passed by the bonfire
and got through a gap in the hedge into another
field&mdash;a dark one; and far away, beyond quite a number of
other dark fields, the Northern Lights shone and sparkled
and twinkled.</p>

<p>Now, during the winter the Arctic regions come much
farther south than they are marked on the map. Very few
people know this, though you would think they could tell
it by the ice in the jugs of a morning. And just when
George and Jane were starting for the North Pole, the
Arctic regions had come down very nearly as far as Forest
Hill, so that, as the children walked on, it grew colder and
colder, and presently they saw that the fields were covered
with snow, and there were great icicles hanging from
all the hedges and gates. And the Northern Lights still
seemed some way off.</p>

<p>They were crossing a very rough, snowy field when
Jane first noticed the animals. There were white rabbits
and white hares and all sorts and sizes of white birds, and
some larger creatures in the shadows of the hedges that
Jane was sure were wolves and bears.</p>

<p>"Polar bears and Arctic wolves, of course I mean," she
said, for she did not want George to think her stupid
again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a great hedge at the end of this field, all covered
with snow and icicles; but the children found a place
where there was a hole, and as no bears or wolves
seemed to be just in that part of the hedge, they crept
through and scrambled out of the frozen ditch on the
other side. And then they stood still and held their breath
with wonder.</p>

<p>For in front of them, running straight and smooth right
away to the Northern Lights, lay a great wide road of pure
dark ice, and on each side were tall trees all sparkling with
white frost, and from the boughs of the trees hung strings
of stars threaded on fine moonbeams, and shining so
brightly that it was like a beautiful fairy daylight. Jane said
so; but George said it was like the electric lights at the
Earl's Court Exhibition.</p>

<p>The rows of trees went as straight as ruled lines away&mdash;away
and away&mdash;and at the other end of them shone the
Aurora Borealis.</p>

<p>There was a signpost of silvery snow, and on it in letters
of pure ice the children read: <span class="smcap">This way to the North Pole.</span></p>

<p>Then George said: "Way or no way, I know a slide when
I see one&mdash;so here goes." And he took a run on the frozen
snow, and Jane took a run when she saw him do it, and the
next moment they were sliding away, each with feet half a
yard apart, along the great slide that leads to the North
Pole.</p>

<p>This great slide is made for the convenience of the
Polar bears, who, during the winter months, get their food
from the Army and Navy Stores&mdash;and it is the most perfect
slide in the world. If you have never come across it, it
is because you have never let off fireworks on the
eleventh of December, and have never been thoroughly
naughty and disobedient. But do not be these things in
the hope of finding the great slide&mdash;because you might
find something quite different, and then you will be sorry.</p>

<p>The great slide is like common slides in that when once
you have started you have to go on to the end&mdash;unless
you fall down&mdash;and then it hurts just as much as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
smaller kind on ponds. The great slide runs downhill all
the way, so that you keep on going faster and faster and
faster. George and Jane went so fast that they had not
time to notice the scenery. They only saw the long lines of
frosted trees and the starry lamps, and on each side, rushing
back as they slid on, a very broad, white world and a
very large, black night; and overhead as well as in the
trees the stars were bright like silver lamps, and far ahead
shone and trembled and sparkled the line of fairy spears.
Jane said that, and George said: "I can see the Northern
Lights quite plain."</p>

<p>It is very pleasant to slide and slide and slide on clear,
dark ice&mdash;especially if you feel you are really going somewhere,
and more especially if that somewhere is the
North Pole. The children's feet made no noise on the ice,
and they went on and on in a beautiful white silence. But
suddenly the silence was shattered and a cry rang out
over the snow.</p>

<p>"Hey! You there! Stop!"</p>

<p>"Tumble for your life!" cried George, and he fell down at
once, because it is the only way to stop. Jane fell on top
of him&mdash;and then they crawled on hands and knees to the
snow at the edge of the slide&mdash;and there was a sportsman,
dressed in a peaked cap and a frozen moustache, like the
one you see in the pictures about Ice-Peter, and he had a
gun in his hand.</p>

<p>"You don't happen to have any bullets about you?" said
he.</p>

<p>"No," George said, truthfully. "I had five of father's
revolver cartridges, but they were taken away the day
Nurse turned out my pockets to see if I had taken the
knob of the bathroom door by mistake."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said the sportsman, "these accidents will
occur. You don't carry firearms, then, I presume?"</p>

<p>"I haven't any fire<i>arms</i>," said George, "but I have a fire<i>work</i>.
It's only a squib one of the boys gave me, if that's
any good." And he began to feel among the string and peppermints,
and buttons and tops and nibs and chalk and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
foreign postage stamps in his knickerbocker pockets.</p>

<p>"One could but try," the sportsman replied, and he held
out his hand.</p>

<p>But Jane pulled at her brother's jacket-tail and whispered,
"Ask him what he wants it for."</p>

<p>So then the sportsman had to confess that he wanted
the firework to kill the white grouse with; and, when they
came to look, there was the white grouse himself, sitting
in the snow, looking quite pale and careworn, and waiting
anxiously for the matter to be decided one way or the
other.</p>

<p>George put all the things back in his pockets, and said,
"No, I shan't. The reason for shooting him stopped yesterday&mdash;I
heard Father say so&mdash;so it wouldn't be fair, anyhow.
I'm very sorry; but I can't&mdash;so there!"</p>

<p>The sportsman said nothing, only he shook his fist at
Jane, and then he got on the slide and tried to go toward
the Crystal Palace&mdash;which was not easy, because that way
is uphill. So they left him trying, and went on.</p>

<p>Before they started, the white grouse thanked them in
a few pleasant, well-chosen words, and then they took a
sideways slanting run and started off again on the great
slide, and so away toward the North Pole and the twinkling,
beautiful lights.</p>

<p>The great slide went on and on, and the lights did not
seem to come much nearer, and the white silence
wrapped around them as they slid along the wide, icy
path. Then once again the silence was broken to bits by
someone calling: "Hey! You there! Stop!"</p>

<p>"Tumble for your life!" cried George, and tumbled as
before, stopping in the only possible way, and Jane
stopped on top of him, and they crawled to the edge and
came suddenly on a butterfly collector, who was looking
for specimens with a pair of blue glasses and a blue net
and a blue book with colored plates.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said the collector, "but have you such a
thing as a needle about you&mdash;a very long needle?"</p>

<p>"I have a needle <i>book</i>," replied Jane, politely, "but there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
aren't any needles in it now. George took them all to do
the things with pieces of cork&mdash;in the 'Boy's Own
Scientific Experimenter' and 'The Young Mechanic.' He
did not do the things, but he did for the needles."</p>

<p>"Curiously enough," said the collector, "I too wish to
use the needle in connection with cork."</p>

<p>"I have a hatpin in my hood," said Jane. "I fastened the
fur with it when it caught in the nail on the greenhouse
door. It is very long and sharp&mdash;would that do?"</p>

<p>"One could but try," said the collector, and Jane began
to feel for the pin. But George pinched her arm and whispered,
"Ask what he wants it for." Then the collector had
to own that he wanted the pin to stick through the great
Arctic moth, "a magnificent specimen," he added, "which
I am most anxious to preserve."</p>

<p>And there, sure enough, in the collector's butterfly net
sat the great Arctic moth, listening attentively to the conversation.</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't!" cried Jane. And while George was
explaining to the collector that they would really rather
not, Jane opened the blue folds of the butterfly net, and
asked the moth quietly if it would please step outside for
a moment. And it did.</p>

<p>When the collector saw that the moth was free, he
seemed less angry than grieved.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said he, "here's a whole Arctic expedition
thrown away! I shall have to go home and fit out another.
And that means a lot of writing to the papers and things.
You seem to be a singularly thoughtless little girl."</p>

<p>So they went on, leaving him too, trying to go uphill
towards the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>When the great white Arctic moth had returned thanks
in a suitable speech, George and Jane took a sideways
slanting run and started sliding again, between the star-lamps
along the great slide toward the North Pole. They
went faster and faster, and the lights ahead grew brighter
and brighter&mdash;so that they could not keep their eyes
open, but had to blink and wink as they went&mdash;and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
suddenly the great slide ended in an immense heap of
snow, and George and Jane shot right into it because they
could not stop themselves, and the snow was soft, so that
they went in up to their very ears.</p>

<p>When they had picked themselves out and thumped
each other on the back to get rid of the snow, they
shaded their eyes and looked, and there, right in front of
them, was the wonder of wonders&mdash;the North Pole&mdash;towering
high and white and glistening, like an ice-lighthouse,
and it was quite, quite close, so that you had to put your
head as far back as it would go, and farther, before you
could see the high top of it. It was made entirely of ice.
You will hear grown-up people talk a great deal of nonsense
about the North Pole, and when you are grown up,
it is even possible that you may talk nonsense about it
yourself (the most unlikely things do happen) but deep
down in your heart you must always remember that the
North Pole is made of clear ice, and could not possibly, if
you come to think of it, be made of anything else.</p>

<p>All around the Pole, making a bright ring about it, were
hundreds of little fires, and the flames of them did not
flicker and twist, but went up blue and green and rosy and
straight like the stalks of dream lilies.</p>

<p>Jane said so, but George said they were as straight as
ramrods.</p>

<p>And these flames were the Aurora Borealis, which the
children had seen as far away as Forest Hill.</p>

<p>The ground was quite flat, and covered with smooth,
hard snow, which shone and sparkled like the top of a
birthday cake that has been iced at home. The ones done
at the shops do not shine and sparkle, because they mix
flour with the icing sugar.</p>

<p>"It is like a dream," said Jane.</p>

<p>And George said, "It <i>is</i> the North Pole. Just think of the
fuss people always make about getting here&mdash;and it was
no trouble at all, really."</p>

<p>"I daresay lots of people have gotten here," said Jane,
dismally. "It's not the getting <i>here</i>&mdash;I see that&mdash;it's the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
getting back again. Perhaps no one will ever know that <i>we</i>
have been here, and the robins will cover us with leaves
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said George. "There aren't any robins, and
there aren't any leaves. It's just the North Pole, that's all,
and I've found it; and now I shall try to climb up and plant
the British flag on the top&mdash;my handkerchief will do; and
if it really <i>is</i> the North Pole, my pocket compass Uncle
James gave me will spin around and around, and then I
shall know. Come on."</p>

<p>So Jane came on; and when they got close to the clear,
tall, beautiful flames they saw that there was a great,
queer-shaped lump of ice all around the bottom of the
Pole&mdash;clear, smooth, shining ice, that was deep, beautiful
Prussian blue, like icebergs, in the thick parts, and all
sorts of wonderful, glimmery, shimmery, changing colors
in the thin parts, like the cut-glass chandelier in Grandmamma's
house in London.</p>

<p>"It is a very curious shape," said Jane. "It's almost
like"&mdash;she moved back a step to get a better view of it&mdash;"it's
almost like a dragon."</p>

<p>"It's much more like the lampposts on the Thames
Embankment," said George, who had noticed a curly thing
like a tail that went twisting up the North Pole.</p>

<p>"Oh, George," cried Jane, "it <i>is</i> a dragon; I can see its
wings. Whatever shall we do?"</p>

<p>And, sure enough, it <i>was</i> a dragon&mdash;a great, shining,
winged, scaly, clawy, big-mouthed dragon&mdash;made of pure
ice. It must have gone to sleep curled around the hole
where the warm steam used to come up from the middle
of the earth, and then when the earth got colder, and the
column of steam froze and was turned into the North
Pole, the dragon must have got frozen in his sleep&mdash;frozen
too hard to move&mdash;and there he stayed. And though he
was very terrible he was very beautiful too.</p>

<p>Jane said so, but George said, "Oh, don't bother; I'm
thinking how to get onto the Pole and try the compass
without waking the brute."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/gs12.jpg" width="320" height="339" alt="&quot;Sure enough, it was a dragon.&quot; See page 68." title="&quot;Sure enough, it was a dragon.&quot; See page 68." />
<span class="caption">&quot;Sure enough, it was a dragon.&quot;<br /><a href="#Page_68"><i>See page 68.</i></a></span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The dragon certainly was beautiful, with his deep,
clear Prussian blueness, and his rainbow-colored glitter.
And rising from within the cold coil of the frozen dragon
the North Pole shot up like a pillar made of one great
diamond, and every now and then it cracked a little,
from sheer cold. The sound of the cracking was the only
thing that broke the great white silence in the midst of
which the dragon lay like an enormous jewel, and the
straight flames went up all around him like the stalks of
tall lilies.</p>

<p>And as the children stood there looking at the most
wonderful sight their eyes had ever seen, there was a soft
padding of feet and a hurry-scurry behind them, and from
the outside darkness beyond the flame-stalks came a
crowd of little brown creatures running, jumping, scrambling,
tumbling head over heels and on all fours, and some
even walking on their heads. They joined hands as they
came near the fires and danced around in a ring.</p>

<p>"It's bears," said Jane. "I know it is. Oh, how I wish we
hadn't come; and my boots are so wet."</p>

<p>The dancing-ring broke up suddenly, and the next
moment hundreds of furry arms clutched at George and
Jane, and they found themselves in the middle of a great,
soft, heaving crowd of little fat people in brown fur
dresses, and the white silence was quite gone.</p>

<p>"Bears, indeed," cried a shrill voice. "You'll wish we
were bears before you've done with us."</p>

<p>This sounded so dreadful that Jane began to cry. Up to
now the children had only seen the most beautiful and
wondrous things, but now they began to be sorry they
had done what they were told not to, and the difference
between "lawn" and "grass" did not seem so great as it
had at Forest Hill.</p>

<p>Directly Jane began to cry, all the brown people started
back. No one cries in the Arctic regions for fear of being
struck by the frost. So that these people had never seen
anyone cry before.</p>

<p>"Don't cry for real," whispered George, "or you'll get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
chilblains in your eyes. But pretend to howl&mdash;it frightens
them."</p>

<p>So Jane went on pretending to howl, and the real crying
stopped: It always does when you begin to pretend. You
try it.</p>

<p>Then, speaking very loud so as to be heard over the
howls of Jane, George said: "Yah&mdash;who's afraid? We are
George and Jane&mdash;who are you?"</p>

<p>"We are the sealskin dwarfs," said the brown people,
twisting their furry bodies in and out of the crowd like the
changing glass in kaleidoscopes. "We are very precious
and expensive, for we are made, throughout, of the very
best sealskin."</p>

<p>"And what are those fires for?" bellowed George&mdash;for
Jane was crying louder and louder.</p>

<p>"Those," shouted the dwarfs, coming a step nearer, "are
the fires we make to thaw the dragon. He is frozen now&mdash;so
he sleeps curled up around the Pole&mdash;but when we
have thawed him with our fires he will wake up and go
and eat everybody in the world except us."</p>

<p>"WHATEVER&mdash;DO&mdash;YOU&mdash;WANT&mdash;HIM&mdash;TO&mdash;DO&mdash;THAT&mdash;FOR?"
yelled George.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;just for spite," bawled the dwarfs carelessly&mdash;as
if they were saying, "Just for fun."</p>

<p>Jane stopped crying to say: "You are heartless."</p>

<p>"No, we aren't," they said. "Our hearts are made of the
finest sealskin, just like little fat sealskin purses&mdash;"</p>

<p>And they all came a step nearer. They were very fat and
round. Their bodies were like sealskin jackets on a very
stout person; their heads were like sealskin muffs; their
legs were like sealskin boas; and their hands and feet were
like sealskin tobacco pouches. And their faces were like
seals' faces, inasmuch as they, too, were covered with
sealskin.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much for telling us," said George. "Good
evening. (Keep on howling, Jane!)"</p>

<p>But the dwarfs came a step nearer, muttering and whispering.
Then the muttering stopped&mdash;and there was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
silence so deep that Jane was afraid to howl in it. But it
was a brown silence, and she had liked the white silence
better.</p>

<p>Then the chief dwarf came quite close and said: "What's
that on your head?"</p>

<p>And George felt it was all up&mdash;for he knew it was his
father's sealskin cap.</p>

<p>The dwarf did not wait for an answer. "It's made of one
of us," he screamed, "or else one of the seals, our poor
relations. Boy, now your fate is sealed!"</p>

<p>Looking at the wicked seal-faces all around them,
George and Jane felt that their fate was sealed indeed.</p>

<p>The dwarfs seized the children in their furry arms.
George kicked, but it is no use kicking sealskin, and Jane
howled, but the dwarfs were getting used to that. They
climbed up the dragon's side and dumped the children
down on his icy spine, with their backs against the North
Pole. You have no idea how cold it was&mdash;the kind of cold
that makes you feel small and prickly inside your clothes,
and makes you wish you had twenty times as many
clothes to feel small and prickly inside of.</p>

<p>The sealskin dwarfs tied George and Jane to the North
Pole, and, as they had no ropes, they bound them with
snow-wreaths, which are very strong when they are made
in the proper way, and they heaped up the fires very close
and said: "Now the dragon will get warm, and when he
gets warm he will wake, and when he wakes he will be
hungry, and when he is hungry he will begin to eat, and
the first thing he will eat will be you."</p>

<p>The little, sharp, many-colored flames sprang up like
the stalks of dream lilies, but no heat came to the children,
and they grew colder and colder.</p>

<p>"We shan't be very nice when the dragon does eat us,
that's one comfort," said George. "We shall be turned into
ice long before that."</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a flapping of wings, and the white
grouse perched on the dragon's head and said: "Can I be
of any assistance?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 287px;">
<img src="images/gs13.jpg" width="287" height="400" alt="&quot;The dwarfs seized the children.&quot; See page 72." title="&quot;The dwarfs seized the children.&quot; See page 72." />

<p>Now, by this time the children were so cold, so cold, so
very, very cold, that they had forgotten everything but
that, and they could say nothing else. So the white grouse
said: "One moment. I am only too grateful for this opportunity
of showing my sense of your manly conduct about
the firework!"</p>

<p>And the next moment there was a soft whispering rustle
of wings overhead, and then, fluttering slowly, softly
down, came hundreds and thousands of little white fluffy
feathers. They fell on George and Jane like snowflakes,
and, like flakes of fallen snow lying one above another,
they grew into a thicker and thicker covering, so that
presently the children were buried under a heap of white
feathers, and only their faces peeped out.</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear, good, kind white grouse," said Jane, "but
you'll be cold yourself, won't you, now you have given us
all your pretty dear feathers?"</p>

<p>The white grouse laughed, and his laugh was echoed by
thousands of kind, soft bird voices.</p>

<p>"Did you think all those feathers came out of one
breast? There are hundreds and hundreds of us here, and
every one of us can spare a little tuft of soft breast feathers
to help to keep two kind little hearts warm!"</p>

<p>Thus spoke the grouse, who certainly had very pretty
manners.</p>

<p>So now the children snuggled under the feathers and
were warm, and when the sealskin dwarfs tried to take the
feathers away, the grouse and his friends flew in their
faces with flappings and screams, and drove the dwarfs
back. They are a cowardly folk.</p>

<p>The dragon had not moved yet&mdash;but then he might at
any moment get warm enough to move, and though
George and Jane were now warm they were not comfortable
nor easy in their minds. They tried to explain to the
grouse; but though he is polite, he is not clever, and he
only said: "You've got a warm nest, and we'll see that no
one takes it from you. What more can you possibly want?"</p>

<p>Just then came a new, strange, jerky fluttering of wings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
far softer than the grouse's, and George and Jane cried
out together: "Oh, <i>do</i> mind your wings in the fires!"</p>

<p>For they saw at once that it was the great white Arctic
moth.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked, settling on the dragon's
tail.</p>

<p>So they told him.</p>

<p>"Sealskin, are they?" said the moth. "Just you wait a
minute!"</p>

<p>He flew off very crookedly, dodging the flames, and
presently he came back, and there were so many moths
with him that it was as if a live sheet of white wingedness
were suddenly drawn between the children and the stars.</p>

<p>And then the doom of the bad sealskin dwarfs fell suddenly
on them.</p>

<p>For the great sheet of winged whiteness broke up and
fell as snow falls, and it fell upon the sealskin dwarfs; and
every snowflake of it was a live, fluttering, hungry moth
that buried its greedy nose deep in the sealskin fur.</p>

<p>Grown-up people will tell you that it is not moths but
moths' children who eat fur&mdash;but this is only when they
are trying to deceive you. When they are not thinking
about you they say, "I fear the moths have got at my
ermine tippet," or, "Your poor Aunt Emma had a lovely
sable cloak, but it was eaten by moths." And now there
were more moths than have ever been together in this
world before, all settling on the sealskin dwarfs.</p>

<p>The dwarfs did not see their danger till it was too late.
Then they called for camphor and bitter apple and oil of
lavender and yellow soap and borax; and some of the
dwarfs even started to get these things, but long before
any of them could get to the chemist's, all was over. The
moths ate and ate and ate till the sealskin dwarfs, being
sealskin throughout, even to the empty hearts of them,
were eaten down to the very life&mdash;and they fell one by one
on the snow and so came to their end. And all around the
North Pole the snow was brown with their flat bare pelts.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you&mdash;thank you, darling Arctic moth," cried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Jane. "You are good&mdash;I do hope you haven't eaten enough
to disagree with you afterward!"</p>

<p>Millions of moth voices answered, with laughter as soft
as moth wings, "We should be a poor set of fellows if we
couldn't over eat ourselves once in a while&mdash;to oblige a
friend."</p>

<p>And off they all fluttered, and the white grouse flew off,
and the sealskin dwarfs were all dead, and the fires went
out, and George and Jane were left alone in the dark with
the dragon!</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," said Jane, "this is the worst of all!"</p>

<p>"We've no friends left to help us," said George. He never
thought that the dragon himself might help them&mdash;but
then that was an idea that would never have occurred to
any boy.</p>

<p>It grew colder and colder and colder, and even under
the grouse feathers the children shivered.</p>

<p>Then, when it was so cold that it could not manage to
be any colder without breaking the thermometer, it
stopped. And then the dragon uncurled himself from
around the North Pole, and stretched his long, icy length
over the snow, and said: "This is something like! How faint
those fires did make me feel!"</p>

<p>The fact was, the sealskin dwarfs had gone the wrong
way to work: The dragon had been frozen so long that
now he was nothing but solid ice all through, and the fires
only made him feel as if he were going to die.</p>

<p>But when the fires were out he felt quite well, and very
hungry. He looked around for something to eat. But he
never noticed George and Jane, because they were frozen
to his back.</p>

<p>He moved slowly off, and the snow-wreaths that bound
the children to the Pole gave way with a snap, and there
was the dragon, crawling south&mdash;with Jane and George on
his great, scaly, icy shining back. Of course the dragon
had to go south if he went anywhere, because when you
get to the North Pole there is no other way to go. The
dragon rattled and tinkled as he went, exactly like the cut-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>glass
chandelier when you touch it, as you are strictly forbidden
to do. Of course there are a million ways of going
south from the North Pole&mdash;so you will own that it was
lucky for George and Jane when the dragon took the right
way and suddenly got his heavy feet on the great slide. Off
he went, full speed, between the starry lamps, toward
Forest Hill and the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>"He's going to take us home," said Jane. "Oh, he is a
good dragon. I <i>am</i> glad!"</p>

<p>George was rather glad too, though neither of the children
felt at all sure of their welcome, especially as their
feet were wet, and they were bringing a strange dragon
home with them.</p>

<p>They went very fast, because dragons can go uphill as
easily as down. You would not understand why if I told
you&mdash;because you are only in long division at present; yet
if you want me to tell you, so that you can show off to
other children, I will. It is because dragons can get their
tails into the fourth dimension and hold on there, and
when you can do that everything else is easy.</p>

<p>The dragon went very fast, only stopping to eat the collector
and the sportsman, who were still struggling to go
up the slide&mdash;vainly, because they had no tails, and had
never even heard of the fourth dimension.</p>

<p>When the dragon got to the end of the slide he crawled
very slowly across the dark field beyond the field where
there was a bonfire, next to the next-door garden at Forest
Hill.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He went slower and slower, and in the bonfire field he
stopped altogether, and because the Arctic regions had
not got down so far as that, and because the bonfire was
very hot, the dragon began to melt and melt and melt&mdash;and
before the children knew what he was doing they
found themselves sitting in a large pool of water, and their
boots were as wet as wet, and there was not a bit of
dragon left!</p>

<p>So they went indoors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course some grown-up or other noticed at once that
the boots of George and Jane were wet and muddy, and
that they had both been sitting down in a very damp
place, so they were sent to bed immediately.</p>

<p>It was long past their time, anyhow.</p>

<p>Now, if you are of an inquiring mind&mdash;not at all a nice
thing in a little child who reads fairy tales&mdash;you will want
to know how it is that since the sealskin dwarfs have all
been killed, and the fires all been let out, the Aurora
Borealis shines, on cold nights, as brightly as ever.</p>

<p>My dear, I do not know! I am not too proud to own that
there are some things I know nothing about&mdash;and this is
one of them. But I do know that whoever has lighted those
fires again, it is certainly not the sealskin dwarfs. They
were all eaten by moths&mdash;and motheaten things are of no
use, even to light fires!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<h2>V. The Island of the Nine Whirlpools</h2>


<p>The dark arch that led to the witch's cave was hung
with a black-and-yellow fringe of live snakes. As the
Queen went in, keeping carefully in the middle of the arch,
all the snakes lifted their wicked, flat heads and stared at
her with their wicked, yellow eyes. You know it is not
good manners to stare, even at Royalty, except of course
for cats. And the snakes had been so badly brought up
that they even put their tongues out at the poor lady.
Nasty, thin, sharp tongues they were too.</p>

<p>Now, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King.
And besides being a King he was an enchanter, and considered
to be quite at the top of his profession, so he was
very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens want
children, the Queen always goes to see a witch. So he gave
the Queen the witch's address, and the Queen called on
her, though she was very frightened and did not like it at
all. The witch was sitting by a fire of sticks, stirring something
bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron.</p>

<p>"What do you want, my dear?" she said to the Queen.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you please," said the Queen, "I want a baby&mdash;a
very nice one. We don't want any expense spared. My husband
said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the witch. "I know all about him. And so
you want a child? Do you know it will bring you sorrow?"</p>

<p>"It will bring me joy first," said the Queen.</p>

<p>"Great sorrow," said the witch.</p>

<p>"Greater joy," said the Queen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the witch said, "Well, have your own way. I suppose
it's as much as your place is worth to go back without
it?"</p>

<p>"The King would be very much annoyed," said the poor
Queen.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the witch. "What will you give me for
the child?"</p>

<p>"Anything you ask for, and all I have," said the Queen.</p>

<p>"Then give me your gold crown."</p>

<p>The Queen took it off quickly.</p>

<p>"And your necklace of blue sapphires."</p>

<p>The Queen unfastened it.</p>

<p>"And your pearl bracelets."</p>

<p>The Queen unclasped them.</p>

<p>"And your ruby clasps."</p>

<p>And the Queen undid the clasps.</p>

<p>"Now the lilies from your breast."</p>

<p>The Queen gathered together the lilies.</p>

<p>"And the diamonds of your little bright shoe buckles."</p>

<p>The Queen pulled off her shoes.</p>

<p>Then the witch stirred the stuff that was in the cauldron,
and, one by one, she threw in the gold crown and
the sapphire necklace and the pearl bracelets and the
ruby clasps and the diamonds of the little bright shoe
buckles, and last of all she threw in the lilies.</p>

<p>The stuff in the cauldron boiled up in foaming flashes of
yellow and blue and red and white and silver, and sent out
a sweet scent, and presently the witch poured it out into
a pot and set it to cool in the doorway among the snakes.</p>

<p>Then she said to the Queen: "Your child will have hair
as golden as your crown, eyes as blue as your sapphires.
The red of your rubies will lie on its lips, and its skin will
be clear and pale as your pearls. Its soul will be white and
sweet as your lilies, and your diamonds will be no clearer
than its wits."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, thank you," said the Queen, "and when
will it come?"</p>

<p>"You will find it when you get home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"And won't you have something for yourself?" asked
the Queen. "Any little thing you fancy&mdash;would you like a
country, or a sack of jewels?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, thank you," said the witch. "I could make
more diamonds in a day than I should wear in a year."</p>

<p>"Well, but do let me do some little thing for you," the
Queen went on. "Aren't you tired of being a witch?
Wouldn't you like to be a Duchess or a Princess, or something
like that?"</p>

<p>"There is one thing I should rather like," said the witch,
"but it's hard to get in my trade."</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me what," said the Queen.</p>

<p>"I should like some one to love me," said the witch.</p>

<p>Then the Queen threw her arms around the witch's
neck and kissed her half a hundred times. "Why," she said,
"I love you better than my life! You've given me the baby&mdash;and
the baby shall love you too."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will," said the witch, "and when the sorrow
comes, send for me. Each of your fifty kisses will be a spell
to bring me to you. Now, drink up your medicine, there's
a dear, and run along home."</p>

<p>So the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite
cool by this time, and she went out under the fringe of
snakes, and they all behaved like good Sunday-school
children. Some of them even tried to drop a curtsy to her
as she went by, though that is not easy when you are
hanging wrong way up by your tail. But the snakes knew
the Queen was friends with their mistress; so, of course,
they had to do their best to be civil.</p>

<p>When the Queen got home, sure enough there was the
baby lying in the cradle with the Royal arms blazoned on
it, crying as naturally as possible. It had pink ribbons to
tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at once it was a girl.
When the King knew this he tore his black hair with fury.</p>

<p>"Oh, you silly, silly Queen!" he said. "Why didn't I marry
a clever lady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and
expense of sending you to a witch to get a girl? You knew
well enough it was a boy I wanted&mdash;a boy, an heir, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Prince&mdash;to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and
to rule the kingdom after me. I'll bet a crown&mdash;my crown,"
he said, "you never even thought to tell the witch what
kind you wanted! Did you now?"</p>

<p>And the Queen hung her head and had to confess that
she had only asked for a child.</p>

<p>"Very well, madam," said the King, "very well&mdash;have
your own way. And make the most of your daughter, while
she is a child."</p>

<p>The Queen did. All the years of her life had never held
half so much happiness as now lived in each of the
moments when she held her little baby in her arms. And
the years went on, and the King grew more and more
clever at magic, and more and more disagreeable at
home, and the Princess grew more beautiful and more
dear every day she lived.</p>

<p>The Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish
in the courtyard fountains with crumbs of the Princess's
eighteenth birthday cake, when the King came into the
courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his black
raven hopping after him. He shook his fist at his family, as
indeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was
not a King with pretty home manners. The raven sat down
on the edge of the marble basin and tried to peck the goldfish.
It was all he could do to show that he was in the same
temper as his master.</p>

<p>"A girl indeed!" said the King angrily. "I wonder you can
dare to look me in the face, when you remember how your
silliness has spoiled everything."</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that," said the
Princess. She was eighteen, and it came to her suddenly
and all in a moment that she was a grown-up, so she spoke
out.</p>

<p>The King could not utter a word for several minutes. He
was too angry. But the Queen said, "My dear child, don't
interfere," quite crossly, for she was frightened.</p>

<p>And to her husband she said, "My dear, why do you go
on worrying about it? Our daughter is not a boy, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
true&mdash;but she may marry a clever man who could rule
your kingdom after you, and learn as much magic as ever
you cared to teach him."</p>

<p>Then the King found his tongue.</p>

<p>"If she does marry," he said, slowly, "her husband will
have to be a very clever man&mdash;oh, yes, very clever
indeed! And he will have to know a very great deal more
magic than I shall ever care to teach him."</p>

<p>The Queen knew at once by the King's tone that he was
going to be disagreeable.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "don't punish the child because she
loves her mother."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to punish her for that," said he. "I'm only
going to teach her to respect her father."</p>

<p>And without another word he went off to his laboratory
and worked all night, boiling different-colored things in
crucibles, and copying charms in curious twisted letters
from old brown books with mold stains on their yellowy
pages.</p>

<p>The next day his plan was all arranged. He took the
poor Princess to the Lone Tower, which stands on an
island in the sea, a thousand miles from everywhere. He
gave her a dowry, and settled a handsome income on her.
He engaged a competent dragon to look after her, and also
a respectable griffin whose birth and upbringing he knew
all about. And he said: "Here you shall stay, my dear,
respectful daughter, till the clever man comes to marry
you. He'll have to be clever enough to sail a ship through
the Nine Whirlpools that spin around the island, and to
kill the dragon and the griffin. Till he comes you'll never
get any older or any wiser. No doubt he will soon come.
You can employ yourself in embroidering your wedding
gown. I wish you joy, my dutiful child."</p>

<p>And his carriage, drawn by live thunderbolts (thunder
travels very fast), rose in the air and disappeared, and the
poor Princess was left, with the dragon and the griffin, on
the Island of the Nine Whirlpools.</p>

<p>The Queen, left at home, cried for a day and a night, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
then she remembered the witch and called to her. And the
witch came, and the Queen told her all.</p>

<p>"For the sake of the twice twenty-five kisses you gave
me," said the witch, "I will help you. But it is the last thing
I can do, and it is not much. Your daughter is under a
spell, and I can take you to her. But, if I do, you will have
to be turned to stone, and to stay so till the spell is taken
off the child."</p>

<p>"I would be a stone for a thousand years," said the poor
Queen, "if at the end of them I could see my dear again."</p>

<p>So the witch took the Queen in a carriage drawn by live
sunbeams (which travel more quickly than anything else
in the world, and much quicker than thunder), and so
away and away to the Lone Tower on the Island of the
Nine Whirlpools. And there was the Princess sitting on
the floor in the best room of the Lone Tower, crying as if
her heart would break, and the dragon and the griffin
were sitting primly on each side of her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother," she cried, and hung
around the Queen's neck as if she would never let go.</p>

<p>"Now," said the witch, when they had all cried as much
as was good for them, "I can do one or two other little
things for you. Time shall not make the Princess sad. All
days will be like one day till her deliverer comes. And you
and I, dear Queen, will sit in stone at the gate of the tower.
In doing this for you I lose all my witch's powers, and
when I say the spell that changes you to stone, I shall
change with you, and if ever we come out of the stone, I
shall be a witch no more, but only a happy old woman."</p>

<p>Then the three kissed one another again and again, and
the witch said the spell, and on each side of the door
there was now a stone lady. One of them had a stone
crown on its head and a stone scepter in its hand; but the
other held a stone tablet with words on it, which the griffin
and the dragon could not read, though they had both
had a very good education.</p>

<p>And now all days seemed like one day to the Princess,
and the next day always seemed the day when her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
mother would come out of the stone and kiss her again.
And the years went slowly by. The wicked King died, and
some one else took his kingdom, and many things were
changed in the world; but the island did not change, nor
the Nine Whirlpools, nor the griffin, nor the dragon, nor
the two stone ladies. And all the time, from the very first,
the day of the Princess's deliverance was coming, creeping
nearer, and nearer, and nearer. But no one saw it coming
except the Princess, and she only in dreams. And the
years went by in tens and in hundreds, and still the Nine
Whirlpools spun around, roaring in triumph the story of
many a good ship that had gone down in their swirl, bearing
with it some Prince who had tried to win the Princess
and her dowry. And the great sea knew all the other stories
of the Princes who had come from very far, and had
seen the whirlpools, and had shaken their wise young
heads and said: "'Bout ship!" and gone discreetly home to
their nice, safe, comfortable kingdoms.</p>

<p>But no one told the story of the deliverer who was to
come. And the years went by.</p>

<p>Now, after more scores of years than you would like to
add up on your slate, a certain sailor-boy sailed on the
high seas with his uncle, who was a skilled skipper. And
the boy could reef a sail and coil a rope and keep the
ship's nose steady before the wind. And he was as good a
boy as you would find in a month of Sundays, and worthy
to be a Prince.</p>

<p>Now there is Something which is wiser than all the
world&mdash;and it knows when people are worthy to be
Princes. And this Something came from the farther side of
the seventh world, and whispered in the boy's ear.</p>

<p>And the boy heard, though he did not know he heard,
and he looked out over the black sea with the white foam-horses
galloping over it, and far away he saw a light. And
he said to the skipper, his uncle: "What light is that?"</p>

<p>Then the skipper said: "All good things defend you,
Nigel, from sailing near that light. It is not mentioned in all
charts; but it is marked in the old chart I steer by, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
was my father's father's before me, and his father's
father's before him. It is the light that shines from the
Lone Tower that stands above the Nine Whirlpools. And
when my father's father was young he heard from the
very old man, his great-great-grandfather, that in that
tower an enchanted Princess, fairer than the day, waits to
be delivered. But there is no deliverance, so never steer
that way; and think no more of the Princess, for that is
only an idle tale. But the whirlpools are quite real."</p>

<p>So, of course, from that day Nigel thought of nothing
else. And as he sailed hither and thither upon the high
seas he saw from time to time the light that shone out to
sea across the wild swirl of the Nine Whirlpools. And one
night, when the ship was at anchor and the skipper asleep
in his bunk, Nigel launched the ship's boat and steered
alone over the dark sea towards the light. He dared not go
very near till daylight should show him what, indeed,
were the whirlpools he had to dread.</p>

<p>But when the dawn came he saw the Lone Tower standing
dark against the pink and primrose of the East, and
about its base the sullen swirl of black water, and he
heard the wonderful roar of it. So he hung off and on, all
that day and for six days besides. And when he had
watched seven days he knew something. For you are certain
to know something if you give for seven days your
whole thought to it, even though it be only the first
declension, or the nine-times table, or the dates of the
Norman Kings.</p>

<p>What he knew was this: that for five minutes out of the
1,440 minutes that make up a day the whirlpools slipped
into silence, while the tide went down and left the yellow
sand bare. And every day this happened, but every day it
was five minutes earlier than it had been the day before.
He made sure of this by the ship's chronometer, which he
had thoughtfully brought with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>So on the eighth day, at five minutes before noon, Nigel
got ready. And when the whirlpools suddenly stopped
whirling and the tide sank, like water in a basin that has a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
hole in it, he stuck to his oars and put his back into his
stroke, and presently beached the boat on the yellow
sand. Then he dragged it into a cave, and sat down to
wait.</p>

<p>By five minutes and one second past noon, the
whirlpools were black and busy again, and Nigel peeped
out of his cave. And on the rocky ledge overhanging the
sea he saw a Princess as beautiful as the day, with golden
hair and a green gown&mdash;and he went out to meet her.</p>

<p>"I've come to save you," he said. "How darling and
beautiful you are!"</p>

<p>"You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,"
said the Princess, smiling and giving him both her hands.</p>

<p>He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.</p>

<p>"So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away
in my boat," he said.</p>

<p>"But what about the dragon and the griffin?" asked the
Princess.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Nigel. "I didn't know about them. I suppose
I can kill them?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a silly boy," said the Princess, pretending to
be very grown up, for, though she had been on the island
time only knows how many years, she was just eighteen,
and she still liked pretending. "You haven't a sword, or a
shield, or anything!"</p>

<p>"Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the Princess, "but only once in twenty-four
hours, and then the dragon is turned to stone. But
the griffin has dreams. The griffin sleeps at teatime every
day, but the dragon sleeps every day for five minutes, and
every day it is three minutes later than it was the day
before."</p>

<p>"What time does he sleep today?" asked Nigel.</p>

<p>"At eleven," said the Princess.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Nigel, "can you do sums?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Princess sadly. "I was never good at
them."</p>

<p>"Then I must," said Nigel. "I can, but it's slow work, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
it makes me very unhappy. It'll take me days and days."</p>

<p>"Don't begin yet," said the Princess. "You'll have plenty
of time to be unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all
about yourself."</p>

<p>So he did. And then she told him all about herself.</p>

<p>"I know I've been here a long time," she said, "but I
don't know what Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk
flowers on a golden gown for my wedding day. And the
griffin does the housework&mdash;his wings are so convenient
and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon
does the cooking&mdash;he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no
trouble to him; and though I don't know what Time is I'm
sure it's time for my wedding day, because my golden
gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve, and
a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready."</p>

<p>Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks
above them and a snorting sound. "It's the dragon," said
the Princess hurriedly. "Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get
your sum done." And she ran away and left him to his
arithmetic.</p>

<p>Now, the sum was this: "If the whirlpools stop and the
tide goes down once in every twenty-four hours, and they
do it five minutes earlier every twenty-four hours, and if
the dragon sleeps every day, and he does it three minutes
later every day, in how many days and at what time in the
day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon
falls asleep?"</p>

<p>It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a
minute because you have been to a good school and have
taken pains with your lessons; but it was quite otherwise
with poor Nigel. He sat down to work out his sum with a
piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by practice
and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by rule-of-three-and-three-quarters.
He tried it by decimals and by
compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube
root. He tried it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he
tried it by mixed examples in vulgar fractions. But it was
all of no use. Then he tried to do the sum by algebra, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry, by
logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He
got an answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different
one, and he could not feel sure which answer was
right.</p>

<p>And just as he was feeling how much more important
than anything else it is to be able to do your sums, the
Princess came back. And now it was getting dark.</p>

<p>"Why, you've been seven hours over that sum," she
said, "and you haven't done it yet. Look here, this is what
is written on the tablet of the statue by the lower gate. It
has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer to the sum."</p>

<p>She held out to him a big white magnolia leaf. And she
had scratched on it with the pin of her pearl brooch, and
it had turned brown where she had scratched it, as magnolia
leaves will do. Nigel read:</p>

<div class='poem'>
AFTER NINE DAYS<br />
T ii. 24.<br />
D ii. 27 Ans.<br />
P.S.&mdash;And the griffin is artificial. R.<br />
</div>

<p>He clapped his hands softly.</p>

<p>"Dear Princess," he said, "I know that's the right answer.
It says R too, you see. But I'll just prove it." So he hastily
worked the sum backward in decimals and equations and
conic sections, and all the rules he could think of. And it
came right every time.</p>

<p>"So now we must wait," said he. And they waited.</p>

<p>And every day the Princess came to see Nigel and
brought him food cooked by the dragon, and he lived in
his cave, and talked to her when she was there, and
thought about her when she was not, and they were both
as happy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came
The Day. Nigel and the Princess laid their plans.</p>

<p>"You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure?" said
Nigel.</p>

<p>"Quite," said the Princess. "I only wish I were half as
sure that he wouldn't hurt you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"My Princess," he said tenderly, "two great powers are
on our side: the power of Love and the power of
Arithmetic. Those two are stronger than anything else in
the world."</p>

<p>So when the tide began to go down, Nigel and the
Princess ran out on to the sands, and there, in full sight of
the terrace where the dragon kept watch, Nigel took his
Princess in his arms and kissed her. The griffin was busy
sweeping the stairs of the Lone Tower, but the dragon
saw, and he gave a cry of rage&mdash;and it was like twenty
engines all letting off steam at the top of their voices
inside Cannon Street Station.</p>

<p>And the two lovers stood looking up at the dragon. He
was dreadful to look at. His head was white with age&mdash;and
his beard had grown so long that he caught his claws in it
as he walked. His wings were white with the salt that had
settled on them from the spray of the sea. His tail was
long and thick and jointed and white, and had little legs to
it, any number of them&mdash;far too many&mdash;so that it looked
like a very large fat silkworm; and his claws were as long
as lessons and as sharp as bayonets.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, love!" cried Nigel, and ran out across the
yellow sand toward the sea. He had one end of a cord tied
to his arm.</p>

<p>The dragon was clambering down the face of the cliff,
and next moment he was crawling and writhing and
sprawling and wriggling across the beach after Nigel, making
great holes in the sand with his heavy feet&mdash;and the
very end of his tail, where there were no legs, made, as it
dragged, a mark in the sand such as you make when you
launch a boat; and he breathed fire till the wet sand
hissed again, and the water of the little rock pools got
quite frightened, and all went off in steam.</p>

<p>Still Nigel held on and the dragon after him. The
Princess could see nothing for the steam, and she stood
crying bitterly, but still holding on tight with her right
hand to the other end of the cord that Nigel had told her
to hold; while with her left she held the ship's chrono<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>meter,
and looked at it through her tears as he had bidden
her look, so as to know when to pull the rope.</p>

<p>On went Nigel over the sand, and on went the dragon
after him. And the tide was low, and sleepy little waves
lapped the sand's edge.</p>

<p>Now at the lip of the water, Nigel paused and looked
back, and the dragon made a bound, beginning a scream
of rage that was like all the engines of all the railways in
England. But it never uttered the second half of that
scream, for now it knew suddenly that it was sleepy&mdash;it
turned to hurry back to dry land, because sleeping near
whirlpools is so unsafe. But before it reached the shore
sleep caught it and turned it to stone. Nigel, seeing this,
ran shoreward for his life&mdash;and the tide began to flow in,
and the time of the whirlpools' sleep was nearly over, and
he stumbled and he waded and he swam, and the Princess
pulled for dear life at the cord in her hand, and pulled him
up on to the dry shelf of rock just as the great sea dashed
in and made itself once more into the girdle of Nine
Whirlpools all around the island.</p>

<p>But the dragon was asleep under the whirlpools, and
when he woke up from being asleep he found he was
drowned, so there was an end of him.</p>

<p>"Now, there's only the griffin," said Nigel. And the
Princess said: "Yes&mdash;only&mdash;" And she kissed Nigel and
went back to sew the last leaf of the last lily on the bosom
of her wedding gown. She thought and thought of what
was written on the stone about the griffin being artificial&mdash;and
next day she said to Nigel: "You know a griffin is
half a lion and half an eagle, and the other two halves
when they've joined make the leo-griff. But I've never seen
him. Yet I have an idea."</p>

<p>So they talked it over and arranged everything.</p>

<p>When the griffin fell asleep that afternoon at teatime,
Nigel went softly behind him and trod on his tail, and at
the same time the Princess cried: "Look out! There's a lion
behind you."</p>

<p>And the griffin, waking suddenly from his dreams, twist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>ed
his large neck around to look for the lion, saw a lion's
flank, and fastened its eagle beak in it. For the griffin had
been artificially made by the King-enchanter, and the two
halves had never really got used to each other. So now the
eagle half of the griffin, who was still rather sleepy,
believed that it was fighting a lion, and the lion part, being
half asleep, thought it was fighting an eagle, and the whole
griffin in its deep drowsiness hadn't the sense to pull itself
together and remember what it was made of. So the griffin
rolled over and over, one end of it fighting with the
other, till the eagle end pecked the lion end to death, and
the lion end tore the eagle end with its claws till it died.
And so the griffin that was made of a lion and an eagle perished,
exactly as if it had been made of Kilkenny cats.</p>

<p>"Poor griffin," said the Princess, "it was very good at
the housework. I always liked it better than the dragon: It
wasn't so hot-tempered."</p>

<p>At that moment there was a soft, silky rush behind the
Princess, and there was her mother, the Queen, who had
slipped out of the stone statue at the moment the griffin
was dead, and now came hurrying to take her dear
daughter in her arms. The witch was clambering slowly
off her pedestal. She was a little stiff from standing still so
long.</p>

<p>When they had all explained everything over and over
to each other as many times as was good for them, the
witch said: "Well, but what about the whirlpools?"</p>

<p>And Nigel said he didn't know. Then the witch said: "I'm
not a witch anymore. I'm only a happy old woman, but I
know some things still. Those whirlpools were made by
the enchanter-King's dropping nine drops of his blood
into the sea. And his blood was so wicked that the sea has
been trying ever since to get rid of it, and that made the
whirlpools. Now you've only got to go out at low tide."</p>

<p>So Nigel understood and went out at low tide, and
found in the sandy hollow left by the first whirlpool a
great red ruby. That was the first drop of the wicked
King's blood. The next day Nigel found another, and next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
day another, and so on till the ninth day, and then the sea
was as smooth as glass.</p>

<p>The nine rubies were used afterwards in agriculture.
You had only to throw them out into a field if you wanted
it plowed. Then the whole surface of the land turned itself
over in its anxiety to get rid of something so wicked, and
in the morning the field was found to be plowed as thoroughly
as any young man at Oxford. So the wicked King
did some good after all.</p>

<p>When the sea was smooth, ships came from far and
wide, bringing people to hear the wonderful story. And a
beautiful palace was built, and the Princess was married
to Nigel in her gold dress, and they all lived happily as
long as was good for them.</p>

<p>The dragon still lies, a stone dragon on the sand, and at
low tide the little children play around him and over him.
But the pieces that were left of the griffin were buried
under the herb-bed in the palace garden, because it had
been so good at housework, and it wasn't its fault that it
had been made so badly and put to such poor work as
guarding a lady from her lover.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that you will wish to know what the
Princess lived on during the long years when the dragon
did the cooking. My dear, she lived on her income&mdash;and
that is a thing that a great many people would like to be
able to do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h2>VI. The Dragon Tamers</h2>


<p>There was once an old, old castle&mdash;it was so old that
its walls and towers and turrets and gateways and
arches had crumbled to ruins, and of all its old splendor
there were only two little rooms left; and it was here that
John the blacksmith had set up his forge. He was too poor
to live in a proper house, and no one asked any rent for
the rooms in the ruin, because all the lords of the castle
were dead and gone this many a year. So there John blew
his bellows and hammered his iron and did all the work
which came his way. This was not much, because most of
the trade went to the mayor of the town, who was also a
blacksmith in quite a large way of business, and had his
huge forge facing the square of the town, and had twelve
apprentices, all hammering like a nest of woodpeckers,
and twelve journeymen to order the apprentices about,
and a patent forge and a self-acting hammer and electric
bellows, and all things handsome about him. So of course
the townspeople, whenever they wanted a horse shod or
a shaft mended, went to the mayor. John the blacksmith
struggled on as best he could, with a few odd jobs from
travelers and strangers who did not know what a superior
forge the mayor's was. The two rooms were warm and
weather-tight, but not very large; so the blacksmith got
into the way of keeping his old iron, his odds and ends,
his fagots, and his twopence worth of coal in the great
dungeon down under the castle. It was a very fine dungeon
indeed, with a handsome vaulted roof and big iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
rings whose staples were built into the wall, very strong
and convenient for tying captives to, and at one end was
a broken flight of wide steps leading down no one knew
where. Even the lords of the castle in the good old times
had never known where those steps led to, but every now
and then they would kick a prisoner down the steps in
their lighthearted, hopeful way, and sure enough, the prisoners
never came back. The blacksmith had never dared
to go beyond the seventh step, and no more have I&mdash;so I
know no more than he did what was at the bottom of
those stairs.</p>

<p>John the blacksmith had a wife and a little baby. When
his wife was not doing the housework she used to nurse
the baby and cry, remembering the happy days when she
lived with her father, who kept seventeen cows and lived
quite in the country, and when John used to come courting
her in the summer evenings, as smart as smart, with a
posy in his buttonhole. And now John's hair was getting
gray, and there was hardly ever enough to eat.</p>

<p>As for the baby, it cried a good deal at odd times; but at
night, when its mother had settled down to sleep, it would
always begin to cry, quite as a matter of course, so that
she hardly got any rest at all. This made her very tired.</p>

<p>The baby could make up for its bad nights during the
day if it liked, but the poor mother couldn't. So whenever
she had nothing to do she used to sit and cry, because she
was tired out with work and worry.</p>

<p>One evening the blacksmith was busy with his forge. He
was making a goat-shoe for the goat of a very rich lady,
who wished to see how the goat liked being shod, and also
whether the shoe would come to fivepence or sevenpence
before she ordered the whole set. This was the only order
John had had that week. And as he worked his wife sat and
nursed the baby, who, for a wonder, was not crying.</p>

<p>Presently, over the noise of the bellows and over the
clank of the iron, there came another sound. The blacksmith
and his wife looked at each other.</p>

<p>"I heard nothing," said he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither did I," said she.</p>

<p>But the noise grew louder&mdash;and the two were so anxious
not to hear it that he hammered away at the goat-shoe
harder than he had ever hammered in his life, and
she began to sing to the baby&mdash;a thing she had not had
the heart to do for weeks.</p>

<p>But through the blowing and hammering and singing
the noise came louder and louder, and the more they tried
not to hear it, the more they had to. It was like the noise
of some great creature purring, purring, purring&mdash;and the
reason they did not want to believe they really heard it
was that it came from the great dungeon down below,
where the old iron was, and the firewood and the
twopence worth of coal, and the broken steps that went
down into the dark and ended no one knew where.</p>

<p>"It can't be anything in the dungeon," said the blacksmith,
wiping his face. "Why, I shall have to go down there
after more coals in a minute."</p>

<p>"There isn't anything there, of course. How could there
be?" said his wife. And they tried so hard to believe that
there could be nothing there that presently they very
nearly did believe it.</p>

<p>Then the blacksmith took his shovel in one hand and
his riveting hammer in the other, and hung the old stable
lantern on his little finger, and went down to get the coals.</p>

<p>"I am not taking the hammer because I think there is
something there," said he, "but it is handy for breaking
the large lumps of coal."</p>

<p>"I quite understand," said his wife, who had brought the
coal home in her apron that very afternoon, and knew
that it was all coal dust.</p>

<p>So he went down the winding stairs to the dungeon and
stood at the bottom of the steps, holding the lantern
above his head just to see that the dungeon really was
empty, as usual. Half of it was empty as usual, except for
the old iron and odds and ends, and the firewood and the
coals. But the other side was not empty. It was quite full,
and what it was full of was Dragon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must have come up those nasty broken steps from
goodness knows where," said the blacksmith to himself,
trembling all over, as he tried to creep back up the winding
stairs.</p>

<p>But the dragon was too quick for him&mdash;it put out a great
claw and caught him by the leg, and as it moved it rattled
like a great bunch of keys, or like the sheet iron they make
thunder out of in pantomimes.</p>

<p>"No you don't," said the dragon in a spluttering voice,
like a damp squib.</p>

<p>"Deary, deary me," said poor John, trembling more than
ever in the claw of the dragon. "Here's a nice end for a
respectable blacksmith!"</p>

<p>The dragon seemed very much struck by this remark.</p>

<p>"Do you mind saying that again?" said he, quite politely.</p>

<p>So John said again, very distinctly: "<i>Here</i>&mdash;<i>is</i>&mdash;<i>a</i>&mdash;<i>nice</i>&mdash;<i>end</i>&mdash;<i>for</i>&mdash;<i>a</i>&mdash;<i>respectable</i>&mdash;<i>blacksmith.</i>"</p>

<p>"I didn't know," said the dragon. "Fancy now! You're the
very man I wanted."</p>

<p>"So I understood you to say before," said John, his teeth
chattering.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean what you mean," said the dragon,
"but I should like you to do a job for me. One of my wings
has got some of the rivets out of it just above the joint.
Could you put that to rights?"</p>

<p>"I might, sir," said John, politely, for you must always be
polite to a possible customer, even if he be a dragon.</p>

<p>"A master craftsman&mdash;you are a master, of course?&mdash;can
see in a minute what's wrong," the dragon went on.
"Just come around here and feel my plates, will you?"</p>

<p>John timidly went around when the dragon took his
claw away; and sure enough, the dragon's wing was hanging
loose, and several of the plates near the joint certainly
wanted riveting.</p>

<p>The dragon seemed to be made almost entirely of iron
armor&mdash;a sort of tawny, red-rust color it was; from damp,
no doubt&mdash;and under it he seemed to be covered with
something furry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>All the blacksmith welled up in John's heart, and he felt
more at ease.</p>

<p>"You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir," said he.
"In fact, you want a good many."</p>

<p>"Well, get to work, then," said the dragon. "You mend
my wing, and then I'll go out and eat up all the town, and
if you make a really smart job of it I'll eat you last. There!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to be eaten last, sir," said John.</p>

<p>"Well then, I'll eat you first," said the dragon.</p>

<p>"I don't want that, sir, either," said John.</p>

<p>"Go on with you, you silly man," said the dragon, "you
don't know your own silly mind. Come, set to work."</p>

<p>"I don't like the job, sir," said John, "and that's the truth.
I know how easily accidents happen. It's all fair and
smooth, and 'Please rivet me, and I'll eat you last'&mdash;and
then you get to work and you give a gentleman a bit of a
nip or a dig under his rivets&mdash;and then it's fire and smoke,
and no apologies will meet the case."</p>

<p>"Upon my word of honor as a dragon," said the other.</p>

<p>"I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir," said John,
"but any gentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's
nipped, and one of your sniffs would be enough for me.
Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up?"</p>

<p>"It would be so undignified," objected the dragon.</p>

<p>"We always fasten a horse up," said John, "and he's the
'noble animal.'"</p>

<p>"It's all very well," said the dragon, "but how do I know
you'd untie me again when you'd riveted me? Give me
something in pledge. What do you value most?"</p>

<p>"My hammer," said John. "A blacksmith is nothing without
a hammer."</p>

<p>"But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of
something else, and at once, or I'll eat you first."</p>

<p>At this moment the baby in the room above began to
scream. Its mother had been so quiet that it thought she
had settled down for the night, and that it was time to
begin.</p>

<p>"Whatever's that?" said the dragon, starting so that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
every plate on his body rattled.</p>

<p>"It's only the baby," said John.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the dragon. "Something you value?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir, rather," said the blacksmith.</p>

<p>"Then bring it here," said the dragon, "and I'll take care
of it till you've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said John, "but I ought to warn you.
Babies are poison to dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's
all right to touch&mdash;but don't you go putting it into your
mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come to a nice-looking
gentleman like you."</p>

<p>The dragon purred at this compliment and said: "All
right, I'll be careful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever
it is."</p>

<p>So John ran up the steps as quickly as he could, for he
knew that if the dragon got impatient before it was fastened,
it could heave up the roof of the dungeon with one
heave of its back, and kill them all in the ruins. His wife
was asleep, in spite of the baby's cries; and John picked
up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragon's
front paws.</p>

<p>"You just purr to it, sir," he said, "and it'll be as good as
gold."</p>

<p>So the dragon purred, and his purring pleased the baby
so much that it stopped crying.</p>

<p>Then John rummaged among the heap of old iron and
found there some heavy chains and a great collar that had
been made in the days when men sang over their work
and put their hearts into it, so that the things they made
were strong enough to bear the weight of a thousand
years, let alone a dragon.</p>

<p>John fastened the dragon up with the collar and the
chains, and when he had padlocked them all on safely he
set to work to find out how many rivets would be needed.</p>

<p>"Six, eight, ten&mdash;twenty, forty," said he. "I haven't half
enough rivets in the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step
around to another forge and get a few dozen. I won't be a
minute."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>And off he went, leaving the baby between the dragon's
fore-paws, laughing and crowing with pleasure at the very
large purr of it.</p>

<p>John ran as hard as he could into the town, and found
the mayor and corporation.</p>

<p>"There's a dragon in my dungeon," he said; "I've
chained him up. Now come and help to get my baby
away."</p>

<p>And he told them all about it.</p>

<p>But they all happened to have engagements for that
evening; so they praised John's cleverness, and said they
were quite content to leave the matter in his hands.</p>

<p>"But what about my baby?" said John.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said the mayor, "if anything should happen,
you will always be able to remember that your baby perished
in a good cause."</p>

<p>So John went home again, and told his wife some of the
tale.</p>

<p>"You've given the baby to the dragon!" she cried. "Oh,
you unnatural parent!"</p>

<p>"Hush," said John, and he told her some more. "Now,"
he said, "I'm going down. After I've been down you can go,
and if you keep your head the boy will be all right."</p>

<p>So down went the blacksmith, and there was the
dragon purring away with all his might to keep the baby
quiet.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, can't you?" he said. "I can't keep up this
noise all night."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, sir," said the blacksmith, "but all the
shops are shut. The job must wait till the morning. And
don't forget you've promised to take care of that baby.
You'll find it a little wearing, I'm afraid. Good night, sir."</p>

<p>The dragon had purred till he was quite out of breath&mdash;so
now he stopped, and as soon as everything was quiet
the baby thought everyone must have settled for the
night, and that it was time to begin to scream. So it began.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," said the dragon, "this is awful." He patted
the baby with his claw, but it screamed more than ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I am so tired too," said the dragon. "I did so hope
I should have a good night."</p>

<p>The baby went on screaming.</p>

<p>"There'll be no peace for me after this," said the dragon.
"It's enough to ruin one's nerves. Hush, then&mdash;did 'ums,
then." And he tried to quiet the baby as if it had been a
young dragon. But when he began to sing "Hush-a-by,
Dragon," the baby screamed more and more and more. "I
can't keep it quiet," said the dragon; and then suddenly he
saw a woman sitting on the steps. "Here, I say," said he,
"do you know anything about babies?"</p>

<p>"I do, a little," said the mother.</p>

<p>"Then I wish you'd take this one, and let me get some
sleep," said the dragon, yawning. "You can bring it back in
the morning before the blacksmith comes."</p>

<p>So the mother picked up the baby and took it upstairs
and told her husband, and they went to bed happy, for
they had caught the dragon and saved the baby.</p>

<p>And next day John went down and explained carefully
to the dragon exactly how matters stood, and he got an
iron gate with a grating to it and set it up at the foot of the
steps, and the dragon mewed furiously for days and days,
but when he found it was no good he was quiet.</p>

<p>So now John went to the mayor, and said: "I've got the
dragon and I've saved the town."</p>

<p>"Noble preserver," cried the mayor, "we will get up a
subscription for you, and crown you in public with a laurel
wreath."</p>

<p>So the mayor put his name down for five pounds, and
the corporation each gave three, and other people gave
their guineas and half guineas and half crowns and
crowns, and while the subscription was being made the
mayor ordered three poems at his own expense from the
town poet to celebrate the occasion. The poems were
very much more admired, especially by the mayor and
corporation.</p>

<p>The first poem dealt with the noble conduct of the
mayor in arranging to have the dragon tied up. The sec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>ond
described the splendid assistance rendered by the
corporation. And the third expressed the pride and joy of
the poet in being permitted to sing such deeds, beside
which the actions of St. George must appear quite
commonplace to all with a feeling heart or a well-balanced
brain.</p>

<p>When the subscription was finished there was a thousand
pounds, and a committee was formed to settle what
should be done with it. A third of it went to pay for a banquet
to the mayor and corporation; another third was
spent in buying a gold collar with a dragon on it for the
mayor and gold medals with dragons on them for the corporation;
and what was left went in committee expenses.</p>

<p>So there was nothing for the blacksmith except the laurel
wreath and the knowledge that it really was he who
had saved the town. But after this things went a little better
with the blacksmith. To begin with, the baby did not
cry so much as it had before. Then the rich lady who
owned the goat was so touched by John's noble action
that she ordered a complete set of shoes at 2 shillings, 4
pence, and even made it up to 2 shillings, 6 pence, in
grateful recognition of his public-spirited conduct. Then
tourists used to come in breaks from quite a long way off,
and pay twopence each to go down the steps and peep
through the iron grating at the rusty dragon in the dungeon&mdash;and
it was threepence extra for each party if the
blacksmith let off colored fire to see it by, which, as the
fire was extremely short, was twopence-halfpenny clear
profit every time. And the blacksmith's wife used to provide
teas at ninepence a head, and altogether things grew
brighter week by week.</p>

<p>The baby&mdash;named John, after his father, and called
Johnnie for short&mdash;began presently to grow up. He was
great friends with Tina, the daughter of the whitesmith,
who lived nearly opposite. She was a dear little girl with
yellow pigtails and blue eyes, and she was tired of hearing
the story of how Johnnie, when he was a baby, had been
minded by a real dragon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The two children used to go together to peep through
the iron grating at the dragon, and sometimes they would
hear him mew piteously. And they would light a halfpenny's
worth of colored fire to look at him by. And they
grew older and wiser.</p>

<p>At last one day the mayor and corporation, hunting the
hare in their gold gowns, came screaming back to the
town gates with the news that a lame, humpy giant, as big
as a tin church, was coming over the marshes toward the
town.</p>

<p>"We're lost," said the mayor. "I'd give a thousand
pounds to anyone who could keep that giant out of the
town. I know what he eats&mdash;by his teeth."</p>

<p>No one seemed to know what to do. But Johnnie and
Tina were listening, and they looked at each other, and
ran off as fast as their boots would carry them.</p>

<p>They ran through the forge, and down the dungeon
steps, and knocked at the iron door. "Who's there?" said
the dragon. "It's only us," said the children.</p>

<p>And the dragon was so dull from having been alone for
ten years that he said: "Come in, dears."</p>

<p>"You won't hurt us, or breathe fire at us or anything?"
asked Tina.</p>

<p>And the dragon said, "Not for worlds."</p>

<p>So they went in and talked to him, and told him what
the weather was like outside, and what there was in the
papers, and at last Johnnie said: "There's a lame giant in
the town. He wants you."</p>

<p>"Does he?" said the dragon, showing his teeth. "If only I
were out of this!"</p>

<p>"If we let you loose you might manage to run away
before he could catch you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I might," answered the dragon, "but then again I
mightn't."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;you'd never fight him?" said Tina.</p>

<p>"No," said the dragon; "I'm all for peace, I am. You let
me out, and you'll see."</p>

<p>So the children loosed the dragon from the chains and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the collar, and he broke down one end of the dungeon and
went out&mdash;only pausing at the forge door to get the blacksmith
to rivet his wing.</p>

<p>He met the lame giant at the gate of the town, and the
giant banged on the dragon with his club as if he were
banging an iron foundry, and the dragon behaved like a
smelting works&mdash;all fire and smoke. It was a fearful sight,
and people watched it from a distance, falling off their
legs with the shock of every bang, but always getting up
to look again.</p>

<p>At last the dragon won, and the giant sneaked away
across the marshes, and the dragon, who was very tired,
went home to sleep, announcing his intention of eating the
town in the morning. He went back into his old dungeon
because he was a stranger in the town, and he did not know
of any other respectable lodging. Then Tina and Johnnie
went to the mayor and corporation and said, "The giant is
settled. Please give us the thousand pounds reward."</p>

<p>But the mayor said: "No, no, my boy. It is not you who
have settled the giant, it is the dragon. I suppose you have
chained him up again? When he comes to claim the
reward he shall have it."</p>

<p>"He isn't chained up yet," said Johnnie. "Shall I send
him to claim the reward?"</p>

<p>But the mayor said he need not trouble; and now he
offered a thousand pounds to anyone who would get the
dragon chained up again.</p>

<p>"I don't trust you," said Johnnie. "Look how you treated
my father when he chained up the dragon."</p>

<p>But the people who were listening at the door interrupted,
and said that if Johnnie could fasten up the
dragon again they would turn out the mayor and let
Johnnie be mayor in his place. For they had been dissatisfied
with the mayor for some time, and thought they
would like a change.</p>

<p>So Johnnie said, "Done," and off he went, hand in hand
with Tina, and they called on all their little friends and
said: "Will you help us to save the town?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>And all the children said: "Yes, of course we will. What
fun!"</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Tina, "you must all bring your basins
of bread and milk to the forge tomorrow at breakfast
time."</p>

<p>"And if ever I am mayor," said Johnnie, "I will give a banquet,
and you shall be invited. And we'll have nothing but
sweet things from beginning to end."</p>

<p>All the children promised, and next morning Tina and
Johnnie rolled their big washing tub down the winding
stair.</p>

<p>"What's that noise?" asked the dragon.</p>

<p>"It's only a big giant breathing," said Tina, "He's gone by
now."</p>

<p>Then, when all the town children brought their bread
and milk, Tina emptied it into the wash tub, and when the
tub was full Tina knocked at the iron door with the grating
in it and said: "May we come in?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the dragon, "it's very dull here."</p>

<p>So they went in, and with the help of nine other children
they lifted the washing tub in and set it down by the
dragon. Then all the other children went away, and Tina
and Johnnie sat down and cried.</p>

<p>"What's this?" asked the dragon. "And what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"This is bread and milk," said Johnnie; "it's our breakfast&mdash;all
of it."</p>

<p>"Well," said the dragon, "I don't see what you want with
breakfast. I'm going to eat everyone in the town as soon
as I've rested a little."</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Dragon," said Tina, "I wish you wouldn't eat
us. How would you like to be eaten yourself?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," the dragon confessed, "but nobody will eat
me."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Johnnie, "there's a giant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. I fought with him, and licked him."</p>

<p>"Yes, but there's another come now&mdash;the one you
fought was only this one's little boy. This one is half as big
again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's seven times as big," said Tina.</p>

<p>"No, nine times," said Johnnie. "He's bigger than the
steeple."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," said the dragon. "I never expected this."</p>

<p>"And the mayor has told him where you are," Tina went
on, "and he is coming to eat you as soon as he has sharpened
his big knife. The mayor told him you were a wild
dragon&mdash;but he didn't mind. He said he only ate wild
dragons&mdash;with bread sauce."</p>

<p>"That's tiresome," said the dragon. "And I suppose this
sloppy stuff in the tub is the bread sauce?"</p>

<p>The children said it was. "Of course," they added,
"bread sauce is only served with wild dragons. Tame ones
are served with apple sauce and onion stuffing. What a
pity you're not a tame one: He'd never look at you then,"
they said. "Good-bye, poor dragon, we shall never see you
again, and now you'll know what it's like to be eaten." And
they began to cry again.</p>

<p>"Well, but look here," said the dragon, "couldn't you
pretend I was a tame dragon? Tell the giant that I'm just a
poor little timid tame dragon that you kept for a pet."</p>

<p>"He'd never believe it," said Johnnie. "If you were our
tame dragon we should keep you tied up, you know. We
shouldn't like to risk losing such a dear, pretty pet."</p>

<p>Then the dragon begged them to fasten him up at once,
and they did so: with the collar and chains that were
made years ago&mdash;in the days when men sang over their
work and made it strong enough to bear any strain.</p>

<p>And then they went away and told the people what they
had done, and Johnnie was made mayor, and had a glorious
feast exactly as he had said he would&mdash;with nothing
in it but sweet things. It began with Turkish delight and
halfpenny buns, and went on with oranges, toffee,
coconut ice, peppermints, jam puffs, raspberry-noyeau,
ice creams, and meringues, and ended with bull's-eyes
and gingerbread and acid drops.</p>

<p>This was all very well for Johnnie and Tina; but if you
are kind children with feeling hearts you will perhaps feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sorry for the poor deceived, deluded dragon&mdash;chained up
in the dull dungeon, with nothing to do but to think over
the shocking untruths that Johnnie had told him.</p>

<p>When he thought how he had been tricked, the poor
captive dragon began to weep&mdash;and the large tears fell
down over his rusty plates. And presently he began to feel
faint, as people sometimes do when they have been crying,
especially if they have not had anything to eat for ten
years or so.</p>

<p>And then the poor creature dried his eyes and looked
about him, and there he saw the tub of bread and milk. So
he thought, "If giants like this damp, white stuff, perhaps
I should like it too," and he tasted a little, and liked it so
much that he ate it all up.</p>

<p>And the next time the tourists came, and Johnnie let off
the colored fire, the dragon said shyly: "Excuse my troubling
you, but could you bring me a little more bread and
milk?"</p>

<p>So Johnnie arranged that people should go around with
carts every day to collect the children's bread and milk
for the dragon. The children were fed at the town's
expense&mdash;on whatever they liked; and they ate nothing
but cake and buns and sweet things, and they said the
poor dragon was very welcome to their bread and milk.</p>

<p>Now, when Johnnie had been mayor ten years or so he
married Tina, and on their wedding morning they went to
see the dragon. He had grown quite tame, and his rusty
plates had fallen off in places, and underneath he was soft
and furry to stroke. So now they stroked him.</p>

<p>And he said, "I don't know how I could ever have liked
eating anything but bread and milk. I <i>am</i> a tame dragon
now, aren't I?" And when they said that yes, he was, the
dragon said: "I am so tame, won't you undo me?" And
some people would have been afraid to trust him, but
Johnnie and Tina were so happy on their wedding day
that they could not believe any harm of anyone in the
world. So they loosened the chains, and the dragon said:
"Excuse me a moment, there are one or two little things I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
should like to fetch," and he moved off to those mysterious
steps and went down them, out of sight into the darkness.
And as he moved, more and more of his rusty plates
fell off.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they heard him clanking up the steps.
He brought something in his mouth&mdash;it was a bag of gold.</p>

<p>"It's no good to me," he said. "Perhaps you might find it
useful." So they thanked him very kindly.</p>

<p>"More where that came from," said he, and fetched
more and more and more, till they told him to stop. So
now they were rich, and so were their fathers and mothers.
Indeed, everyone was rich, and there were no more
poor people in the town. And they all got rich without
working, which is very wrong; but the dragon had never
been to school, as you have, so he knew no better.</p>

<p>And as the dragon came out of the dungeon, following
Johnnie and Tina into the bright gold and blue of their
wedding day, he blinked his eyes as a cat does in the sunshine,
and he shook himself, and the last of his plates
dropped off, and his wings with them, and he was just like
a very, very extra-sized cat. And from that day he grew
furrier and furrier, and he was the beginning of all cats.
Nothing of the dragon remained except the claws, which
all cats have still, as you can easily ascertain.</p>

<p>And I hope you see now how important it is to feed your
cat with bread and milk. If you were to let it have nothing
to eat but mice and birds it might grow larger and fiercer,
and scalier and tailier, and get wings and turn into the
beginning of dragons. And then there would be all the
bother over again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<h2>VII. The Fiery Dragon,<br />
or The Heart of Stone and the Heart of Gold</h2>


<p>The little white Princess always woke in her little white
bed when the starlings began to chatter in the pearl
gray morning. As soon as the woods were awake, she used
to run up the twisting turret-stairs with her little bare feet,
and stand on the top of the tower in her white bed-gown,
and kiss her hands to the sun and to the woods and to the
sleeping town, and say: "Good morning, pretty world!"</p>

<p>Then she would run down the cold stone steps and
dress herself in her short skirt and her cap and apron, and
begin the day's work. She swept the rooms and made the
breakfast, she washed the dishes and she scoured the
pans, and all this she did because she was a real Princess.
For of all who should have served her, only one remained
faithful&mdash;her old nurse, who had lived with her in the
tower all the Princess's life. And, now the nurse was old
and feeble, the Princess would not let her work any more,
but did all the housework herself, while Nurse sat still and
did the sewing, because this was a real Princess with skin
like milk and hair like flax and a heart like gold.</p>

<p>Her name was Sabrinetta, and her grandmother was
Sabra, who married St. George after he had killed the
dragon, and by real rights all the country belonged to her:
the woods that stretched away to the mountains, the
downs that sloped down to the sea, the pretty fields of
corn and maize and rye, the olive orchards and the vineyards,
and the little town itself&mdash;with its towers and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
turrets, its steep roofs and strange windows&mdash;that nestled
in the hollow between the sea, where the whirlpool was,
and the mountains, white with snow and rosy with
sunrise.</p>

<p>But when her father and mother had died, leaving her
cousin to take care of the kingdom till she grew up, he,
being a very evil Prince, took everything away from her,
and all the people followed him, and now nothing was left
her of all her possessions except the great dragon proof
tower that her grandfather, St. George, had built, and of all
who should have been her servants only the good nurse.</p>

<p>This was why Sabrinetta was the first person in all the
land to get a glimpse of the wonder.</p>

<p>Early, early, early, while all the townspeople were fast
asleep, she ran up the turret-steps and looked out over
the field, and at the other side of the field there was a
green, ferny ditch and a rose-thorny hedge, and then
came the wood. And as Sabrinetta stood on her tower she
saw a shaking and a twisting of the rose-thorny hedge,
and then something very bright and shining wriggled out
through it into the ferny ditch and back again. It only
came out for a minute, but she saw it quite plainly, and
she said to herself: "Dear me, what a curious, shiny,
bright-looking creature! If it were bigger, and if I didn't
know that there have been no fabulous monsters for quite
a long time now, I should almost think it was a dragon."</p>

<p>The thing, whatever it was, did look rather like a
dragon&mdash;but then it was too small; and it looked rather
like a lizard&mdash;only then it was too big. It was about as long
as a hearthrug.</p>

<p>"I wish it had not been in such a hurry to get back into
the wood," said Sabrinetta. "Of course, it's quite safe for
me, in my dragonproof tower; but if it is a dragon, it's
quite big enough to eat people, and today's the first of
May, and the children go out to get flowers in the wood."</p>

<p>When Sabrinetta had done the housework (she did not
leave so much as a speck of dust anywhere, even in the
corneriest corner of the winding stair) she put on her milk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
white, silky gown with the moon-daisies worked on it, and
went up to the top of her tower again.</p>

<p>Across the fields troops of children were going out to
gather the may, and the sound of their laughter and
singing came up to the top of the tower.</p>

<p>"I do hope it wasn't a dragon," said Sabrinetta.</p>

<p>The children went by twos and by threes and by tens and
by twenties, and the red and blue and yellow and white of
their frocks were scattered on the green of the field.</p>

<p>"It's like a green silk mantle worked with flowers," said
the Princess, smiling.</p>

<p>Then by twos and by threes, by tens and by twenties,
the children vanished into the wood, till the mantle of the
field was left plain green once more.</p>

<p>"All the embroidery is unpicked," said the Princess,
sighing.</p>

<p>The sun shone, and the sky was blue, and the fields
were quite green, and all the flowers were very bright
indeed, because it was May Day.</p>

<p>Then quite suddenly a cloud passed over the sun, and
the silence was broken by shrieks from far off; and, like a
many-colored torrent, all the children burst from the
wood and rushed, a red and blue and yellow and white
wave, across the field, screaming as they ran. Their
voices came up to the Princess on her tower, and she
heard the words threaded on their screams like beads on
sharp needles: "The dragon, the dragon, the dragon! Open
the gates! The dragon is coming! The fiery dragon!"</p>

<p>And they swept across the field and into the gate of the
town, and the Princess heard the gate bang, and the children
were out of sight&mdash;but on the other side of the field
the rose-thorns crackled and smashed in the hedge, and
something very large and glaring and horrible trampled
the ferns in the ditch for one moment before it hid itself
again in the covert of the wood.</p>

<p>The Princess went down and told her nurse, and the
nurse at once locked the great door of the tower and put
the key in her pocket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let them take care of themselves," she said, when the
Princess begged to be allowed to go out and help to take
care of the children. "My business is to take care of you,
my precious, and I'm going to do it. Old as I am, I can turn
a key still."</p>

<p>So Sabrinetta went up again to the top of her tower, and
cried whenever she thought of the children and the fiery
dragon. For she knew, of course, that the gates of the town
were not dragonproof, and that the dragon could just
walk in whenever he liked.</p>

<p>The children ran straight to the palace, where the
Prince was cracking his hunting whip down at the kennels,
and told him what had happened.</p>

<p>"Good sport," said the Prince, and he ordered out his
pack of hippopotamuses at once. It was his custom to
hunt big game with hippopotamuses, and people would
not have minded that so much&mdash;but he would swagger
about in the streets of the town with his pack yelping and
gamboling at his heels, and when he did that, the green-grocer,
who had his stall in the marketplace, always
regretted it; and the crockery merchant, who spread his
wares on the pavement, was ruined for life every time the
Prince chose to show off his pack.</p>

<p>The Prince rode out of the town with his hippopotamuses
trotting and frisking behind him, and people got
inside their houses as quickly as they could when they
heard the voices of his pack and the blowing of his horn.
The pack squeezed through the town gates and off across
country to hunt the dragon. Few of you who had not seen
a pack of hippopotamuses in full cry will be able to imagine
at all what the hunt was like. To begin with, hippopotamuses
do not bay like hounds: They grunt like
pigs, and their grunt is very big and fierce. Then, of
course, no one expects hippopotamuses to jump. They
just crash through the hedges and lumber through the
standing corn, doing serious injury to the crops, and
annoying the farmers very much. All the hippopotamuses
had collars with their name and address on, but when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
farmers called at the palace to complain of the injury to
their standing crops, the Prince always said it served
them right for leaving their crops standing about in people's
way, and he never paid anything at all.</p>

<p>So now, when he and his pack went out, several people
in the town whispered, "I wish the dragon would eat
him"&mdash;which was very wrong of them, no doubt, but then
he was such a very nasty Prince.</p>

<p>They hunted by field, and they hunted by wold; they
drew the woods blank, and the scent didn't lie on the
downs at all. The dragon was shy, and would not show
himself.</p>

<p>But just as the Prince was beginning to think there was
no dragon at all, but only a cock and bull, his favourite old
hippopotamus gave tongue. The Prince blew his horn and
shouted: "Tally ho! Hark forward! Tantivy!" and the whole
pack charged downhill toward the hollow by the wood.
For there, plain to be seen, was the dragon, as big as a
barge, glowing like a furnace, and spitting fire and showing
his shining teeth.</p>

<p>"The hunt is up!" cried the Prince. And indeed it was.
For the dragon&mdash;instead of behaving as a quarry should,
and running away&mdash;ran straight at the pack, and the
Prince, on his elephant, had the mortification of seeing
his prize pack swallowed up one by one in the twinkling
of an eye, by the dragon they had come out to hunt. The
dragon swallowed all the hippopotamuses just as a dog
swallows bits of meat. It was a shocking sight. Of the
whole of the pack that had come out sporting so merrily
to the music of the horn, now not even a puppy-hippopotamus
was left, and the dragon was looking anxiously
around to see if he had forgotten anything.</p>

<p>The Prince slipped off his elephant on the other side
and ran into the thickest part of the wood. He hoped the
dragon could not break through the bushes there, since
they were very strong and close. He went crawling on
hands and knees in a most un-Prince-like way, and at
last, finding a hollow tree, he crept into it. The wood was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
very still&mdash;no crashing of branches and no smell of burning
came to alarm the Prince. He drained the silver hunting
bottle slung from his shoulder, and stretched his legs
in the hollow tree. He never shed a single tear for his
poor tame hippopotamuses who had eaten from his
hand and followed him faithfully in all the pleasures of
the chase for so many years. For he was a false Prince,
with a skin like leather and hair like hearth brushes and
a heart like a stone. He never shed a tear, but he just
went to sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was dark. He crept out of the tree and
rubbed his eyes. The wood was black about him, but there
was a red glow in a dell close by. It was a fire of sticks, and
beside it sat a ragged youth with long, yellow hair; all
around lay sleeping forms which breathed heavily.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said the Prince.</p>

<p>"I'm Elfin, the pig keeper," said the ragged youth. "And
who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm Tiresome, the Prince," said the other.</p>

<p>"And what are you doing out of your palace at this time
of night?" asked the pig keeper, severely.</p>

<p>"I've been hunting," said the Prince.</p>

<p>The pig keeper laughed. "Oh, it was you I saw, then? A
good hunt, wasn't it? My pigs and I were looking on."</p>

<p>All the sleeping forms grunted and snored, and the
Prince saw that they were pigs: He knew it by their
manners.</p>

<p>"If you had known as much as I do," Elfin went on, "you
might have saved your pack."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Tiresome.</p>

<p>"Why, the dragon," said Elfin. "You went out at the
wrong time of day. The dragon should be hunted at night."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said the Prince, with a shudder. "A
daylight hunt is quite good enough for me, you silly pig
keeper."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Elfin, "do as you like about it&mdash;the dragon
will come and hunt you tomorrow, as likely as not. I
don't care if he does, you silly Prince."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're very rude," said Tiresome.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, only truthful," said Elfin.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me the truth, then. What is it that, if I had
known as much as you do about, I shouldn't have lost my
hippopotamuses?"</p>

<p>"You don't speak very good English," said Elfin. "But
come, what will you give me if I tell you?"</p>

<p>"If you tell me what?" said the tiresome Prince.</p>

<p>"What you want to know."</p>

<p>"I don't want to know anything," said Prince Tiresome.</p>

<p>"Then you're more of a silly even than I thought," said
Elfin. "Don't you want to know how to settle the dragon
before he settles you?"</p>

<p>"It might be as well," the Prince admitted.</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't much patience at any time," said Elfin,
"and now I can assure you that there's very little left.
What will you give me if I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Half my kingdom," said the Prince, "and my cousin's
hand in marriage."</p>

<p>"Done," said the pig keeper. "Here goes! The dragon
grows small at night! He sleeps under the root of this tree.
I use him to light my fire with."</p>

<p>And, sure enough, there under the tree was the dragon
on a nest of scorched moss, and he was about as long as
your finger.</p>

<p>"How can I kill him?" asked the Prince.</p>

<p>"I don't know that you can kill him," said Elfin, "but you
can take him away if you've brought anything to put him
in. That bottle of yours would do."</p>

<p>So between them they managed, with bits of stick and
by singeing their fingers a little, to poke and shove the
dragon till they made it creep into the silver hunting
bottle, and then the Prince screwed on the top tight.</p>

<p>"Now we've got him," said Elfin. "Let's take him home
and put Solomon's seal on the mouth of the bottle, and
then he'll be safe enough. Come along&mdash;we'll divide up
the kingdom tomorrow, and then I shall have some money
to buy fine clothes to go courting in."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>But when the wicked Prince made promises he did not
make them to keep.</p>

<p>"Go on with you! What do you mean?" he said. "I found
the dragon and I've imprisoned him. I never said a word
about courtings or kingdoms. If you say I did, I shall cut
your head off at once." And he drew his sword.</p>

<p>"All right," said Elfin, shrugging his shoulders. "I'm better
off than you are, anyhow."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" spluttered the Prince.</p>

<p>"Why, you've only got a kingdom (and a dragon), but I've
got clean hands (and five and seventy fine black pigs)."</p>

<p>So Elfin sat down again by his fire, and the Prince went
home and told his Parliament how clever and brave he
had been, and though he woke them up on purpose to tell
them, they were not angry, but said: "You are indeed
brave and clever." For they knew what happened to
people with whom the Prince was not pleased.</p>

<p>Then the Prime Minister solemnly put Solomon's seal
on the mouth of the bottle, and the bottle was put in the
Treasury, which was the strongest building in the town,
and was made of solid copper, with walls as thick as
Waterloo Bridge.</p>

<p>The bottle was set down among the sacks of gold, and
the junior secretary to the junior clerk of the last Lord of
the Treasury was appointed to sit up all night with it and
see if anything happened. The junior secretary had never
seen a dragon, and, what was more, he did not believe the
Prince had ever seen a dragon either. The Prince had
never been a really truthful boy, and it would have been
just like him to bring home a bottle with nothing in it and
then to pretend that there was a dragon inside. So the
junior secretary did not at all mind being left. They gave
him the key, and when everyone in the town had gone
back to bed he let in some of the junior secretaries from
other Government departments, and they had a jolly
game of hide-and-seek among the sacks of gold, and
played marbles with the diamonds and rubies and pearls
in the big ivory chests.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>They enjoyed themselves very much, but by-and-by the
copper treasury began to get warmer and warmer, and
suddenly the junior secretary cried out, "Look at the
bottle!"</p>

<p>The bottle sealed with Solomon's seal had swollen to
three times its proper size and seemed to be nearly red
hot, and the air got warmer and warmer and the bottle
bigger and bigger, till all the junior secretaries agreed that
the place was too hot to hold them, and out they went,
tumbling over each other in their haste, and just as the
last got out and locked the door the bottle burst, and out
came the dragon, very fiery, and swelling more and more
every minute, and he began to eat the sacks of gold and
crunch up the pearls and diamonds and rubies as if they
were sugar.</p>

<p>By breakfasttime he had devoured the whole of the
Prince's treasures, and when the Prince came along the
street at about eleven, he met the dragon coming out of
the broken door of the Treasury, with molten gold still
dripping from his jaws. Then the Prince turned and ran
for his life, and as he ran toward the dragonproof tower
the little white Princess saw him coming, and she ran
down and unlocked the door and let him in, and slammed
the dragonproof door in the fiery face of the dragon, who
sat down and whined outside, because he wanted the
Prince very much indeed.</p>

<p>The Princess took Prince Tiresome into the best room,
and laid the cloth, and gave him cream and eggs and
white grapes and honey and bread, with many other
things, yellow and white and good to eat, and she served
him just as kindly as she would have done if he had been
anyone else instead of the bad Prince who had taken away
her kingdom and kept it for himself&mdash;because she was a
true Princess and had a heart of gold.</p>

<p>When he had eaten and drunk, he begged the Princess
to show him how to lock and unlock the door. The nurse
was asleep, so there was no one to tell the Princess not to,
and she did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"You turn the key like this," she said, "and the door
keeps shut. But turn it nine times around the wrong way,
and the door flies open."</p>

<p>And so it did. And the moment it opened, the Prince
pushed the white Princess out of her tower, just as he had
pushed her out of her kingdom, and shut the door. For he
wanted to have the tower all for himself. And there she
was, in the street, and on the other side of the way the
dragon was sitting whining, but he did not try to eat her,
because&mdash;though the old nurse did not know it&mdash;dragons
cannot eat white Princesses with hearts of gold.</p>

<p>The Princess could not walk through the streets of the
town in her milky-silky gown with the daisies on it, and
with no hat and no gloves, so she turned the other way,
and ran out across the meadows, toward the wood. She
had never been out of her tower before, and the soft grass
under her feet felt like grass of Paradise.</p>

<p>She ran right into the thickest part of the wood,
because she did not know what her heart was made of,
and she was afraid of the dragon, and there in a dell she
came on Elfin and his five and seventy fine pigs. He was
playing his flute, and around him the pigs were dancing
cheerfully on their hind legs.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," said the Princess, "do take care of me. I am
so frightened."</p>

<p>"I will," said Elfin, putting his arms around her. "Now
you are quite safe. What were you frightened of?"</p>

<p>"The dragon," she said.</p>

<p>"So it's gotten out of the silver bottle," said Elfin. "I hope
it's eaten the Prince."</p>

<p>"No," said Sabrinetta. "But why?"</p>

<p>He told her of the mean trick that the Prince had played
on him.</p>

<p>"And he promised me half his kingdom and the hand of
his cousin the Princess," said Elfin.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, what a shame!" said Sabrinetta, trying to get
out of his arms. "How dare he?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked, holding her tighter. "It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
<i>was</i> a shame, or at least <i>I</i> thought so. But now he may
keep his kingdom, half and whole, if I may keep what I
have."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the Princess.</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;my pretty, my dear," said Elfin, "and as for
the Princess, his cousin&mdash;forgive me, dearest heart, but
when I asked for her I hadn't seen the real Princess, the
<i>only</i> Princess, <i>my</i> Princess."</p>

<p>"Do you mean me?" said Sabrinetta.</p>

<p>"Who else?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but five minutes ago you hadn't seen me!"</p>

<p>"Five minutes ago I was a pig keeper&mdash;now I've held you
in my arms I'm a Prince, though I should have to keep pigs
to the end of my days."</p>

<p>"But you haven't asked <i>me</i>," said the Princess.</p>

<p>"You asked me to take care of you," said Elfin, "and I
will&mdash;all my life long."</p>

<p>So that was settled, and they began to talk of really
important things, such as the dragon and the Prince, and
all the time Elfin did not know that this was the Princess,
but he knew that she had a heart of gold, and he told her
so, many times.</p>

<p>"The mistake," said Elfin, "was in not having a dragonproof
bottle. I see that now."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all?" said the Princess. "I can easily get you
one of those&mdash;because everything in my tower is dragonproof.
We ought to do something to settle the dragon and
save the little children."</p>

<p>So she started off to get the bottle, but she would not
let Elfin come with her.</p>

<p>"If what you say is true," she said, "if you are sure that
I have a heart of gold, the dragon won't hurt me, and
somebody must stay with the pigs."</p>

<p>Elfin was quite sure, so he let her go.</p>

<p>She found the door of her tower open. The dragon had
waited patiently for the Prince, and the moment he
opened the door and came out&mdash;though he was only out
for an instant to post a letter to his Prime Minister saying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
where he was and asking them to send the fire brigade to
deal with the fiery dragon&mdash;the dragon ate him. Then the
dragon went back to the wood, because it was getting
near his time to grow small for the night.</p>

<p>So Sabrinetta went in and kissed her nurse and made
her a cup of tea and explained what was going to happen,
and that she had a heart of gold, so the dragon couldn't
eat her; and the nurse saw that of course the Princess was
quite safe, and kissed her and let her go.</p>

<p>She took the dragonproof bottle, made of burnished
brass, and ran back to the wood, and to the dell, where
Elfin was sitting among his sleek black pigs, waiting for
her.</p>

<p>"I thought you were never coming back," he said. "You
have been away a year, at least."</p>

<p>The Princess sat down beside him among the pigs, and
they held each other's hands till it was dark, and then the
dragon came crawling over the moss, scorching it as he
came, and getting smaller as he crawled, and curled up
under the root of the tree.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Elfin, "you hold the bottle." Then he
poked and prodded the dragon with bits of stick till it
crawled into the dragonproof bottle. But there was no
stopper.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Elfin. "I'll put my finger in for a stopper."</p>

<p>"No, let me," said the Princess. But of course Elfin
would not let her. He stuffed his finger into the top of the
bottle, and the Princess cried out: "The sea&mdash;the sea&mdash;run
for the cliffs!" And off they went, with the five and
seventy pigs trotting steadily after them in a long black
procession.</p>

<p>The bottle got hotter and hotter in Elfin's hands,
because the dragon inside was puffing fire and smoke
with all his might&mdash;hotter and hotter and hotter&mdash;but
Elfin held on till they came to the cliff edge, and there was
the dark blue sea, and the whirlpool going around and
around.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Elfin lifted the bottle high above his head and hurled it
out between the stars and the sea, and it fell in the middle
of the whirlpool.</p>

<p>"We've saved the country," said the Princess. "You've
saved the little children. Give me your hands."</p>

<p>"I can't," said Elfin. "I shall never be able to take your
dear hands again. My hands are burnt off."</p>

<p>And so they were: There were only black cinders where
his hands ought to have been. The Princess kissed them,
and cried over them, and tore pieces of her silky-milky
gown to tie them up with, and the two went back to the
tower and told the nurse all about everything. And the
pigs sat outside and waited.</p>

<p>"He is the bravest man in the world," said Sabrinetta.
"He has saved the country and the little children; but, oh,
his hands&mdash;his poor, dear, darling hands!"</p>

<p>Here the door of the room opened, and the oldest of the
five and seventy pigs came in. It went up to Elfin and
rubbed itself against him with little loving grunts.</p>

<p>"See the dear creature," said the nurse, wiping away a
tear. "It knows, it knows!"</p>

<p>Sabrinetta stroked the pig, because Elfin had no hands
for stroking or for anything else.</p>

<p>"The only cure for a dragon burn," said the old nurse,
"is pig's fat, and well that faithful creature knows it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't for a kingdom," cried Elfin, stroking the pig
as best he could with his elbow.</p>

<p>"Is there no other cure?" asked the Princess.</p>

<p>Here another pig put its black nose in at the door, and
then another and another, till the room was full of pigs, a
surging mass of rounded blackness, pushing and struggling
to get at Elfin, and grunting softly in the language of
true affection.</p>

<p>"There is one other," said the nurse. "The dear, affectionate
beasts&mdash;they all want to die for you."</p>

<p>"What is the other cure?" said Sabrinetta anxiously.</p>

<p>"If a man is burnt by a dragon," said the nurse, "and a
certain number of people are willing to die for him, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
enough if each should kiss the burn and wish it well in the
depths of his loving heart."</p>

<p>"The number! The number!" cried Sabrinetta.</p>

<p>"Seventy-seven," said the nurse.</p>

<p>"We have only seventy-five pigs," said the Princess,
"and with me that's seventy-six!"</p>

<p>"It must be seventy-seven&mdash;and I really can't die for
him, so nothing can be done," said the nurse, sadly. "He
must have cork hands."</p>

<p>"I knew about the seventy-seven loving people," said
Elfin. "But I never thought my dear pigs loved me so much
as all this, and my dear too&mdash;and, of course, that only
makes it more impossible. There's one other charm that
cures dragon burns, though; but I'd rather be burnt black
all over than marry anyone but you, my dear, my pretty."</p>

<p>"Why, who must you marry to cure your dragon burns?"
asked Sabrinetta.</p>

<p>"A Princess. That's how St. George cured his burns."</p>

<p>"There now! Think of that!" said the nurse. "And I never
heard tell of that cure, old as I am."</p>

<p>But Sabrinetta threw her arms round Elfin's neck, and
held him as though she would never let him go.</p>

<p>"Then it's all right, my dear, brave, precious Elfin," she
cried, "for I am a Princess, and you shall be my Prince.
Come along, Nurse&mdash;don't wait to put on your bonnet.
We'll go and be married this very moment."</p>

<p>So they went, and the pigs came after, moving in stately
blackness, two by two. And, the minute he was married
to the Princess, Elfin's hands got quite well. And the
people, who were weary of Prince Tiresome and his hippopotamuses,
hailed Sabrinetta and her husband as rightful
Sovereigns of the land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;They saw a cloud of steam.&quot;<br /><a href="#Page_135"><i>See page 135.</i></a></span>
</div>

<p>Next morning the Prince and Princess went out to see if
the dragon had been washed ashore. They could see
nothing of him; but when they looked out toward the
whirlpool they saw a cloud of steam; and the fishermen
reported that the water for miles around was hot enough
to shave with! And as the water is hot there to this day, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
may feel pretty sure that the fierceness of that dragon was
such that all the waters of all the sea were not enough to
cool him. The whirlpool is too strong for him to be able to
get out of it, so there he spins around and around forever
and ever, doing some useful work at last, and warming the
water for poor fisher-folk to shave with.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Prince and Princess rule the land well and wisely. The
nurse lives with them, and does nothing but fine sewing,
and only that when she wants to very much. The Prince
keeps no hippopotamuses, and is consequently very popular.
The five and seventy devoted pigs live in white marble
sties with brass knockers and Pig on the doorplate,
and are washed twice a day with Turkish sponges and
soap scented with violets, and no one objects to their following
the Prince when he walks abroad, for they behave
beautifully, and always keep to the footpath, and obey the

<h2>VIII. Kind Little Edmund,<br />
or The Caves and the Cockatrice</h2>


<p>Edmund was a boy. The people who did not like him
said that he was the most tiresome boy that ever
lived, but his grandmother and his other friends said that
he had an inquiring mind. And his granny often added
that he was the best of boys. But she was very kind and
very old.</p>

<p>Edmund loved to find out about things. Perhaps you
will think that in that case he was constant in his attendance
at school, since there, if anywhere, we may learn
whatever there is to be learned. But Edmund did not want
to learn things: He wanted to find things out, which is
quite different. His inquiring mind led him to take clocks
to pieces to see what made them go, to take locks off
doors to see what made them stick. It was Edmund who
cut open the India rubber ball to see what made it
bounce, and he never did see, any more than you did
when you tried the same experiment.</p>

<p>Edmund lived with his grandmother. She loved him
very much, in spite of his inquiring mind, and hardly
scolded him at all when he frizzled up her tortoiseshell
comb in his anxiety to find out whether it was made of
real tortoiseshell or of something that would burn.
Edmund went to school, of course, now and then, and
sometimes he could not prevent himself from learning
something, but he never did it on purpose.</p>

<p>"It is such waste of time," said he. "They only know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
what everybody knows. I want to find out new things that
nobody has thought of but me."</p>

<p>"I don't think you're likely to find out anything that
none of the wise men in the whole world have thought of
all these thousands of years," said Granny.</p>

<p>But Edmund did not agree with her. He played truant
whenever he could, for he was a kindhearted boy, and
could not bear to think of a master's time and labor being
thrown away on a boy like himself&mdash;who did not wish to
learn, only to find out&mdash;when there were so many worthy
lads thirsting for instruction in geography and history
and reading and ciphering, and Mr. Smiles's "Self-Help."</p>

<p>Other boys played truant too, of course&mdash;and these
went nutting or blackberrying or wild plum gathering, but
Edmund never went on the side of the town where the
green woods and hedges grew. He always went up the
mountain where the great rocks were, and the tall, dark
pine trees, and where other people were afraid to go
because of the strange noises that came out of the caves.</p>

<p>Edmund was not afraid of these noises&mdash;though they
were very strange and terrible. He wanted to find out
what made them.</p>

<p>One day he did. He had invented, all by himself, a very
ingenious and new kind of lantern, made with a turnip and
a tumbler, and when he took the candle out of Granny's bedroom
candlestick to put in it, it gave quite a splendid light.</p>

<p>He had to go to school next day, and he was caned for
being absent without leave&mdash;although he very straightforwardly
explained that he had been too busy making
the lantern to have time to come to school.</p>

<p>But the day after he got up very early and took the
lunch Granny had ready for him to take to school&mdash;two
boiled eggs and an apple turnover&mdash;and he took his
lantern and went off as straight as a dart to the mountains
to explore the caves.</p>

<p>The caves were very dark, but his lantern lighted them
up beautifully; and they were most interesting caves, with
stalactites and stalagmites and fossils, and all the things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
you read about in the instructive books for the young. But
Edmund did not care for any of these things just then. He
wanted to find out what made the noises that people were
afraid of, and there was nothing in the caves to tell him.</p>

<p>Presently he sat down in the biggest cave and listened
very carefully, and it seemed to him that he could distinguish
three different sorts of noises. There was a heavy
rumbling sound, like a very large old gentleman asleep
after dinner; and there was a smaller sort of rumble going
on at the same time; and there was a sort of crowing,
clucking sound, such as a chicken might make if it happened
to be as big as a haystack.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Edmund to himself, "that the
clucking is nearer than the others." So he started up again
and explored the caves once more. He found out nothing,
but about halfway up the wall of the cave, he saw a hole.
And, being a boy, he climbed up to it and crept in; and it
was the entrance to a rocky passage. And now the clucking
sounded more plainly than before, and he could
hardly hear the rumbling at all.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> going to find out something at last," said Edmund,
and on he went. The passage wound and twisted, and
twisted and turned, and turned and wound, but Edmund
kept on.</p>

<p>"My lantern's burning better and better," said he
presently, but the next minute he saw that all the light did
not come from his lantern. It was a pale yellow light, and
it shone down the passage far ahead of him through what
looked like the chink of a door.</p>

<p>"I expect it's the fire in the middle of the earth," said
Edmund, who had not been able to help learning about
that at school.</p>

<p>But quite suddenly the fire ahead gave a pale flicker and
went down; and the clucking ceased.</p>

<p>The next moment Edmund turned a corner and found
himself in front of a rocky door. The door was ajar. He
went in, and there was a round cave, like the dome of
St. Paul's. In the middle of the cave was a hole like a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
big hand-washing basin, and in the middle of the basin
Edmund saw a large pale person sitting.</p>

<p>This person had a man's face and a griffin's body, and
big feathery wings, and a snake's tail, and a cock's comb
and neck feathers.</p>

<p>"Whatever are you?" said Edmund.</p>

<p>"I'm a poor starving cockatrice," answered the pale person
in a very faint voice, "and I shall die&mdash;oh, I know I
shall! My fire's gone out! I can't think how it happened; I
must have been asleep. I have to stir it seven times round
with my tail once in a hundred years to keep it alight, and
my watch must have been wrong. And now I shall die."</p>

<p>I think I have said before what a kindhearted boy
Edmund was.</p>

<p>"Cheer up," said he. "I'll light your fire for you." And off
he went, and in a few minutes he came back with a great
armful of sticks from the pine trees outside, and with
these and a lesson book or two that he had forgotten to
lose before, and which, quite by an oversight, were safe in
his pocket, he lit a fire all around the cockatrice. The
wood blazed up, and presently something in the basin
caught fire, and Edmund saw that it was a sort of liquid
that burned like the brandy in a snapdragon. And now the
cockatrice stirred it with his tail and flapped his wings in
it so that some of it splashed out on Edmund's hand and
burnt it rather badly. But the cockatrice grew red and
strong and happy, and its comb grew scarlet, and its feathers
glossy, and it lifted itself up and crowed "Cock-a-trice-a-doodle-doo!"
very loudly and clearly.</p>

<p>Edmund's kindly nature was charmed to see the cockatrice
so much improved in health, and he said: "Don't
mention it; delighted, I'm sure," when the cockatrice
began to thank him.</p>

<p>"But what can I do for you?" said the creature.</p>

<p>"Tell me stories," said Edmund.</p>

<p>"What about?" said the cockatrice.</p>

<p>"About true things that they don't know at school," said
Edmund.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>So the cockatrice began, and he told him about mines
and treasures and geological formations, and about
gnomes and fairies and dragons, and about glaciers and
the Stone Age and the beginning of the world, and about
the unicorn and the phoenix, and about Magic, black and
white.</p>

<p>And Edmund ate his eggs and his turnover, and listened.
And when he got hungry again he said good-bye
and went home. But he came again the next day for more
stories, and the next day, and the next, for a long time.</p>

<p>He told the boys at school about the cockatrice and his
wonderful true tales, and the boys liked the stories; but
when he told the master he was caned for untruthfulness.</p>

<p>"But it's true," said Edmund. "Just you look where the
fire burnt my hand."</p>

<p>"I see you've been playing with fire&mdash;into mischief as
usual," said the master, and he caned Edmund harder
than ever. The master was ignorant and unbelieving: but I
am told that some schoolmasters are not like that.</p>

<p>Now, one day Edmund made a new lantern out of something
chemical that he sneaked from the school laboratory.
And with it he went exploring again to see if he could
find the things that made the other sorts of noises. And in
quite another part of the mountain he found a dark passage,
all lined with brass, so that it was like the inside of
a huge telescope, and at the very end of it he found a
bright green door. There was a brass plate on the door
that said <span class="smcap">mrs. d. knock and ring</span>, and a white label that said
<span class="smcap">call me at three</span>. Edmund had a watch: It had been given
to him on his birthday two days before, and he had not
yet had time to take it to pieces and see what made it go,
so it was still going. He looked at it now. It said a quarter
to three.</p>

<p>Did I tell you before what a kindhearted boy Edmund
was? He sat down on the brass doorstep and waited till
three o'clock. Then he knocked and rang, and there was a
rattling and puffing inside. The great door flew open, and
Edmund had only just time to hide behind it when out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
came an immense yellow dragon, who wriggled off down
the brass cave like a long, rattling worm&mdash;or perhaps
more like a monstrous centipede.</p>

<p>Edmund crept slowly out and saw the dragon stretching
herself on the rocks in the sun, and he crept past the great
creature and tore down the hill into the town and burst
into school, crying out: "There's a great dragon coming!
Somebody ought to do something, or we shall all be
destroyed."</p>

<p>He was caned for untruthfulness without any delay. His
master was never one for postponing a duty.</p>

<p>"But it's true," said Edmund. "You just see if it isn't."</p>

<p>He pointed out of the window, and everyone could see
a vast yellow cloud rising up into the air above the
mountain.</p>

<p>"It's only a thunder shower," said the master, and caned
Edmund more than ever. This master was not like some
masters I know: He was very obstinate, and would not
believe his own eyes if they told him anything different
from what he had been saying before his eyes spoke.</p>

<p>So while the master was writing <i>Lying is very wrong, and
liars must be caned. It is all for their own good</i> on the black-board
for Edmund to copy out seven hundred times,
Edmund sneaked out of school and ran for his life across
the town to warn his granny, but she was not at home. So
then he made off through the back door of the town, and
raced up the hill to tell the cockatrice and ask for his help.
It never occurred to him that the cockatrice might not
believe him. You see, he had heard so many wonderful
tales from him and had believed them all&mdash;and when you
believe all a person's stories they ought to believe yours.
This is only fair.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the cockatrice's cave Edmund stopped,
very much out of breath, to look back at the town. As he
ran he had felt his little legs tremble and shake, while the
shadows of the great yellow cloud fell upon him. Now he
stood once more between warm earth and blue sky, and
looked down on the green plain dotted with fruit trees and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
red-roofed farms and plots of gold corn. In the middle of
that plain the gray town lay, with its strong walls with the
holes pierced for the archers, and its square towers with
holes for dropping melted lead on the heads of strangers;
its bridges and its steeples; the quiet river edged with willow
and alder; and the pleasant green garden place in the
middle of the town, where people sat on holidays to
smoke their pipes and listen to the band.</p>

<p>Edmund saw it all; and he saw, too, creeping across the
plain, marking her way by a black line as everything withered
at her touch, the great yellow dragon&mdash;and he saw
that she was many times bigger than the whole town.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor, dear granny," said Edmund, for he had a
feeling heart, as I ought to have told you before.</p>

<p>The yellow dragon crept nearer and nearer, licking her
greedy lips with her long red tongue, and Edmund knew
that in the school his master was still teaching earnestly
and still not believing Edmund's tale the least little bit.</p>

<p>"He'll jolly well have to believe it soon, anyhow," said
Edmund to himself, and though he was a very tender-hearted
boy&mdash;I think it only fair to tell you that he was
this&mdash;I am afraid he was not as sorry as he ought to have
been to think of the way in which his master was going to
learn how to believe what Edmund said. Then the dragon
opened her jaws wider and wider and wider. Edmund shut
his eyes, for though his master was in the town, the amiable
Edmund shrank from beholding the awful sight.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes again there was no town&mdash;only
a bare place where it had stood, and the dragon licking
her lips and curling herself up to go to sleep, just as
Kitty does when she has quite finished with a mouse.
Edmund gasped once or twice, and then ran into the cave
to tell the cockatrice.</p>

<p>"Well," said the cockatrice thoughtfully, when the tale
had been told. "What then?"</p>

<p>"I don't think you quite understand," said Edmund gently.
"The dragon has swallowed up the town."</p>

<p>"Does it matter?" said the cockatrice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I live there," said Edmund blankly.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the cockatrice, turning over in the
pool of fire to warm its other side, which was chilly,
because Edmund had, as usual, forgotten to close the
cave door. "You can live here with me."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I haven't made my meaning clear," said
Edmund patiently. "You see, my granny is in the town, and
I can't bear to lose my granny like this."</p>

<p>"I don't know what a granny may be," said the cockatrice,
who seemed to be growing weary of the subject,
"but if it's a possession to which you attach any importance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Edmund, losing patience at last.
"Oh&mdash;do help me. What can I do?"</p>

<p>"If I were you," said his friend, stretching itself out in the
pool of flame so that the waves covered him up to his
chin, "I should find the drakling and bring it here."</p>

<p>"But why?" said Edmund. He had gotten into the habit
of asking why at school, and the master had always found
it trying. As for the cockatrice, he was not going to stand
that sort of thing for a moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk to me!" he said, splashing angrily in the
flames. "I give you advice; take it or leave it&mdash;I shan't
bother about you anymore. If you bring the drakling here
to me, I'll tell you what to do next. If not, not."</p>

<p>And the cockatrice drew the fire up close around his
shoulders, tucked himself up in it, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Now this was exactly the right way to manage Edmund,
only no one had ever thought of trying to do it before.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment looking at the cockatrice; the
cockatrice looked at Edmund out of the corner of his eye
and began to snore very loudly, and Edmund understood,
once and for all, that the cockatrice wasn't going to put up
with any nonsense. He respected the cockatrice very
much from that moment, and set off at once to do exactly
as he was told&mdash;for perhaps the first time in his life.</p>

<p>Though he had played truant so often, he knew one or
two things that perhaps you don't know, though you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
always been so good and gone to school regularly. For
instance, he knew that a drakling is a dragon's baby, and
he felt sure that what he had to do was to find the third of
the three noises that people used to hear coming from the
mountains. Of course, the clucking had been the cockatrice,
and the big noise like a large gentleman asleep after
dinner had been the big dragon. So the smaller rumbling
must have been the drakling.</p>

<p>He plunged boldly into the caves and searched and
wandered and wandered and searched, and at last he
came to a third door in the mountain, and on it was written
<span class="smcap">The baby is asleep</span>. Just before the door stood fifty pairs
of copper shoes, and no one could have looked at them
for a moment without seeing what sort of feet they were
made for, for each shoe had five holes in it for the drakling's
five claws. And there were fifty pairs because the
drakling took after his mother, and had a hundred feet&mdash;no
more and no less. He was the kind called <i>Draco centipedis</i>
in the learned books.</p>

<p>Edmund was a good deal frightened, but he remembered
the grim expression of the cockatrice's eye, and the
fixed determination of his snore still rang in his ears, in
spite of the snoring of the drakling, which was, in itself,
considerable. He screwed up his courage, flung the door
open, and called out: "Hello, you drakling. Get out of bed
this minute."</p>

<p>The drakling stopped snoring and said sleepily: "It ain't
time yet."</p>

<p>"Your mother says you are to, anyhow; and look sharp
about it, what's more," said Edmund, gaining courage
from the fact that the drakling had not yet eaten him.</p>

<p>The drakling sighed, and Edmund could hear it getting
out of bed. The next moment it began to come out of its
room and to put on its shoes. It was not nearly so big as
its mother; only about the size of a Baptist chapel.</p>

<p>"Hurry up," said Edmund, as it fumbled clumsily with
the seventeenth shoe.</p>

<p>"Mother said I was never to go out without my shoes,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
said the drakling; so Edmund had to help it to put
them on. It took some time, and was not a comfortable
occupation.</p>

<p>At last the drakling said it was ready, and Edmund, who
had forgotten to be frightened, said, "Come on then," and
they went back to the cockatrice.</p>

<p>The cave was rather narrow for the drakling, but it
made itself thin, as you may see a fat worm do when it
wants to get through a narrow crack in a piece of hard
earth.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Edmund, and the cockatrice woke up
at once and asked the drakling very politely to sit down
and wait. "Your mother will be here presently," said the
cockatrice, stirring up its fire.</p>

<p>The drakling sat down and waited, but it watched the
fire with hungry eyes.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," it said at last, "but I am always
accustomed to having a little basin of fire as soon as I get
up, and I feel rather faint. Might I?"</p>

<p>It reached out a claw toward the cockatrice's basin.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said the cockatrice sharply. "Where
were you brought up? Did they never teach you that 'we
must not ask for all we see'? Eh?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said the drakling humbly, "but I am
really <i>very</i> hungry."</p>

<p>The cockatrice beckoned Edmund to the side of the
basin and whispered in his ear so long and so earnestly
that one side of the dear boy's hair was quite burnt off.
And he never once interrupted the cockatrice to ask why.
But when the whispering was over, Edmund&mdash;whose
heart, as I may have mentioned, was very tender&mdash;said to
the drakling: "If you are really hungry, poor thing, I can
show you where there is plenty of fire." And off he went
through the caves, and the drakling followed.</p>

<p>When Edmund came to the proper place he stopped.</p>

<p>There was a round iron thing in the floor, like the ones
the men shoot the coals down into your cellar, only much
larger. Edmund heaved it up by a hook that stuck out at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
one side, and a rush of hot air came up that nearly
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'chocked'">choked</ins> him. But the drakling came close and looked
down with one eye and sniffed, and said: "That smells
good, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Edmund, "well, that's the fire in the middle
of the earth. There's plenty of it, all done to a turn. You'd
better go down and begin your breakfast, hadn't you?"</p>

<p>So the drakling wriggled through the hole, and began to
crawl faster and faster down the slanting shaft that leads
to the fire in the middle of the earth. And Edmund, doing
exactly as he had been told, for a wonder, caught the end
of the drakling's tail and ran the iron hook through it so
that the drakling was held fast. And it could not turn
around and wriggle up again to look after its poor tail,
because, as everyone knows, the way to the fires below is
very easy to go down, but quite impossible to come back
on. There is something about it in Latin, beginning:
"<i>Facilis descensus</i>."</p>

<p>So there was the drakling, fast by the silly tail of it, and
there was Edmund very busy and important and very
pleased with himself, hurrying back to the cockatrice.</p>

<p>"Now," said he.</p>

<p>"Well, now," said the cockatrice. "Go to the mouth of the
cave and laugh at the dragon so that she hears you."</p>

<p>Edmund very nearly said "Why?" but he stopped in
time, and instead, said: "She won't hear me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said the cockatrice. "No doubt you
know best," and he began to tuck himself up again in the
fire, so Edmund did as he was bid.</p>

<p>And when he began to laugh his laughter echoed in the
mouth of the cave till it sounded like the laughter of a
whole castleful of giants.</p>

<p>And the dragon, lying asleep in the sun, woke up and
said very crossly: "What are you laughing at?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 235px;">
<img src="images/gs25.jpg" width="235" height="325" alt="&quot;That smells good, eh?&quot; See page 152." title="&quot;That smells good, eh?&quot; See page 152." />
<span class="caption">&quot;That smells good, eh?&quot;<br /><a href="#Page_152"><i>See page 152.</i></a></span>
</div>

<p>"At you," said Edmund, and went on laughing. The
dragon bore it as long as she could, but, like everyone
else, she couldn't stand being made fun of, so presently
she dragged herself up the mountain very slowly, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
she had just had a rather heavy meal, and stood outside
and said, "What are you laughing at?" in a voice that made
Edmund feel as if he should never laugh again.</p>

<p>Then the good cockatrice called out: "At you! You've
eaten your own drakling&mdash;swallowed it with the town.
Your own little drakling! He, he, he! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>And Edmund found the courage to cry "Ha, ha!" which
sounded like tremendous laughter in the echo of the cave.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said the dragon. "I <i>thought</i> the town stuck in
my throat rather. I must take it out, and look through it
more carefully." And with that <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'he'">she</ins> coughed&mdash;and
choked&mdash;and there was the town, on the hillside.</p>

<p>Edmund had run back to the cockatrice, and it had told
him what to do. So before the dragon had time to look
through the town again for her drakling, the voice of the
drakling itself was heard howling miserably from inside
the mountain, because Edmund was pinching its tail as
hard as he could in the round iron door, like the one
where the men pour the coals out of the sacks into the cellar.
And the dragon heard the voice and said: "Why, whatever's
the matter with Baby? He's not here!" and made
herself thin, and crept into the mountain to find her drakling.
The cockatrice kept on laughing as loud as it could,
and Edmund kept on pinching, and presently the great
dragon&mdash;very long and narrow she had made herself&mdash;found
her head where the round hole was with the iron
lid. Her tail was a mile or two off&mdash;outside the mountain.
When Edmund heard her coming he gave one last nip to
the drakling's tail, and then heaved up the lid and stood
behind it, so that the dragon could not see him. Then he
loosed the drakling's tail from the hook, and the dragon
peeped down the hole just in time to see her drakling's
tail disappear down the smooth, slanting shaft with one
last squeak of pain. Whatever may have been the poor
dragon's other faults, she was an excellent mother. She
plunged headfirst into the hole, and slid down the shaft
after her baby. Edmund watched her head go&mdash;and then
the rest of her. She was so long, now she had stretched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
herself thin, that it took all night. It was like watching a
goods train go by in Germany. When the last joint of her
tail had gone Edmund slammed down the iron door. He
was a kindhearted boy, as you have guessed, and he was
glad to think that dragon and drakling would now have
plenty to eat of their favorite food, forever and ever. He
thanked the cockatrice for his kindness, and got home
just in time to have breakfast and get to school by nine.
Of course, he could not have done this if the town had
been in its old place by the river in the middle of the plain,
but it had taken root on the hillside just where the dragon
left it.</p>

<p>"Well," said the master, "where were you yesterday?"</p>

<p>Edmund explained, and the master at once caned him
for not speaking the truth.</p>

<p>"But it <i>is</i> true," said Edmund. "Why, the whole town was
swallowed by the dragon. You know it was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said the master. "There was a thunderstorm
and an earthquake, that's all." And he caned
Edmund more than ever.</p>

<p>"But," said Edmund, who always would argue, even in
the least favorable circumstances, "how do you account
for the town being on the hillside now, instead of by the
river as it used to be?"</p>

<p>"It was <i>always</i> on the hillside," said the master. And all
the class said the same, for they had more sense than to
argue with a person who carried a cane.</p>

<p>"But look at the maps," said Edmund, who wasn't going
to be beaten in argument, whatever he might be in the
flesh. The master pointed to the map on the wall.</p>

<p>There was the town, on the hillside! And nobody but
Edmund could see that of course the shock of being swallowed
by the dragon had upset all the maps and put them
wrong.</p>

<p>And then the master caned Edmund again, explaining
that this time it was not for untruthfulness, but for his
vexatious argumentative habits. This will show you what
a prejudiced and ignorant man Edmund's master was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&mdash;how
different from the revered Head of the nice school
where your good parents are kind enough to send you.</p>

<p>The next day Edmund thought he would prove his tale
by showing people the cockatrice, and he actually persuaded
some people to go into the cave with him; but the
cockatrice had bolted himself in and would not open the
door&mdash;so Edmund got nothing by that except a scolding
for taking people on a wild-goose chase.</p>

<p>"A wild goose," said they, "is nothing like a cockatrice."</p>

<p>And poor Edmund could not say a word, though he
knew how wrong they were. The only person who
believed him was his granny. But then she was very old
and very kind, and had always said he was the best of
boys.</p>

<p>Only one good thing came of all this long story. Edmund
has never been quite the same boy since. He does not
argue quite so much, and he agreed to be apprenticed to
a locksmith, so that he might one day be able to pick the
lock of the cockatrice's front door&mdash;and learn some more
of the things that other people don't know.</p>

<p>But he is quite an old man now, and he hasn't gotten
that door open yet!</p>
